<p><strong>Printer errors:</strong> A number of printer errors have been corrected.  These are marked by light underlining and a title attribute which can be accessed by hovering with the mouse. For example, <ins class="corr" title="Original read &lsquo;txet.&rsquo;">text</ins>.

Inconsistent hyphenation and inconsistent use of -ise and -ize spellings have been left as in the original.</p>

<p><strong>Layout:</strong> The exercises which are here given in shaded boxes were in the original book provided in the footnote-space at the bottom of pages.  So they often occured mid-paragraph; here they have been moved to a more appropriate place.
These lists, and those on pages <a href="#p92">92</a>&ndash;<a href="#p94">94</a> and <a href="#p167">167</a>, were originally wrapped rather than placing each item on a new line.  They have been unwrapped to aid legibility.
The styling of chapter and section headings was inconsistent in the original. Here we have retained the use of capitals or small-capitals, and have decided to mark those headings occurring in the Table of Contents as chapter headings, and make a best guess as to the logical level of the other headings used.</p>

<p><strong>Greek:</strong> The Greek words on <a href="#p129">page 129</a> are exactly as in the original, with no attempt made to correct errors.  Some browsers may not display accented Greek letters, but a transliteration of the whole word can be accessed by hovering with the mouse. For example, <span lang="el" xml:lang="el" title=
  "emporos">&#7956;&mu;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>


<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Expansions of abbreviations have been provided using the &lt;abbr&gt; tag, and changes in language are marked.
The book contains many words in which some though not all of the letters are in italics, for example <i>S</i>wo<i>rdsm</i>a<i>n</i>.  This may cause problems for some screenreaders.  If necessary, one might edit the file to remove all &lt;i&gt;&hellip;&lt;/i&gt; markup: emphasis of other words will not be lost, since they have been marked instead using &lt;em&gt;.

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Prof. A.&nbsp;Loisette</span> wishes to call the attention of those who are now for
the first time becoming acquainted with his System of Memory Training,
that he was the first teacher of a Memory System to announce and to
insist that Memory is not a <em>separate faculty</em> whose office it is to
carry the recollective burdens of the other faculties&mdash;but that Memory
is a Physiological and Psychological property of each mental act, and
that such act retains the traces and history of its own action, and that
there are as many memories as there are kinds of mental action, and
that, therefore, Memory is always concrete, although, for convenience
sake, we do speak of it in the abstract, and that consequently all
Memory improvement means <em>improvement of the Action</em> or <em>Manner</em> of
action of the Mental powers, and that what he imparts is the right way
to <strong class="smcap">use</strong> the Intellect and Attention&mdash;and that hence his System does make
and must make better observers, clearer and more consecutive thinkers,
and sounder reasoners as well as surer rememberers; that in short the
fundamental principle of his System is Learn by Thinking, and that his
achievements as a mind-trainer are completed when he has helped the
student of his System to acquire the Habit of Attention and the Habit of
Thinking on that to which he is attending on all occasions, which two
Habits combined constitute the Habit of Assimilation, and that when this
Habit of Assimilation is thus established in the pupil&#8217;s mind, the
System as such is no longer consciously used.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="FUNDAMENTAL-PRINCIPLES" id="FUNDAMENTAL-PRINCIPLES"></a>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is the basic principle of my system? It is, <em>Learn</em> by <em>Thinking</em>.
What is <em>Attention</em>? It is the will directing the activity of the
<em>intellect</em> into some particular channel <em>and keeping it there</em>. It is
the opposite of mind-wandering. What is thinking? It consists in
<em>finding relations</em> between the objects of thought with an <em>immediate
awareness</em> of those relations.</p>

<p>What is the Sensuous memory? It is association through the eye or ear of
a <em>succession</em> of sights or sounds without any reflection or
consideration of the units of the succession, or what they stand for, or
represent. It is learning by <em>rote</em>&mdash;mere repetition&mdash;mere brainless or
thoughtless repetition&mdash;a mode of learning that is not lasting&mdash;and
always causes or promotes mind-wandering.</p>

<p>What is Assimilative memory? It is the <em>habit</em> of so <em>receiving</em> and
<em>absorbing</em> impressions or ideas that they or their representatives
shall be <em>ready for revival or recall whenever wanted</em>. It is learning
through relations&mdash;by thinking&mdash;from grasping the ideas or thoughts&mdash;the
meaning and the comprehension of the subject matter. This mode of
learning promotes attention and prevents mind-wandering.</p>

<p>What are the two stages of the Memory? Let me illustrate: Last week,
month, or year you saw a military procession pass along the streets.
Note how your mind was affected. Into your eyes went impressions as to
the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;2">&zwnj;</span><a name="p2" id="p2"></a> number composing the procession, their style of costume or dress,
the orderliness or otherwise of their march, the shape and form of the
musical instruments in the hands of the band, and the appearance of the
officer in charge on horseback. Into your ears went impressions of the
sound of the tramp and tread of the soldiers, the tune played by the
band, and any commands uttered by the officer. These impressions
commingling in your brain made up your experience of the passing of the
procession&mdash;your first and only experience of it at <em>that</em> time. I call
this the First Stage of the Memory&mdash;the stage of the <em>First Impression</em>,
which is always the precursor of the Second Stage.</p>

<p>What is the Second Stage of the Memory? This moment you recall what? Not
the procession itself; for it is no longer in existence. You saw and
heard it then, but you do not see or hear it now. You only recall the
impression left upon your mind by the procession. A ray of Consciousness
is passed over that impression and you re-read it, you re-awaken the
record. This is the Second Stage of the Memory&mdash;the <em>revival</em> of the
previous experience&mdash;the recall to consciousness of the First
Impression. The First Impression with no power to revive it afterward,
gives no memory. However great the power of Revival, there is no memory
unless there was a First Impression. There are three conditions of
memory&mdash;(1) Impression. (2) Its Preservation. (3) Its Revival. We are
mainly concerned here with the Impression and its Revival.</p>

<p>There are (<em>five</em>) kinds of memories rising from the natural aptitudes
of different individuals&mdash;(1) First Impressions are apt to be feeble and
the power to revive them weak&mdash;a poor memory. (2) First Impressions are
usually weak but the power to revive them is strong&mdash;still a poor
memory. (3) First Impressions are usually vivid but the power to revive
them is weak&mdash;a poor memory. (4) First Impressions on all subjects are
strong and the power to revive them is strong&mdash;a first-class memory. (5)
First Impressions in some particulars are very strong and the reviving
power in regard to them is very strong&mdash;a good memory for these
particulars, or a memory good for mathematics,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;3">&zwnj;</span><a name="p3" id="p3"></a> or music, or faces, or
reciting, or languages, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, but usually weak in most other respects.</p>

<p><strong class="smcap">Since we are to learn by thinking we must at the outset learn the
definition of the three Laws of Thinking.</strong></p>


<h3>THREE LAWS OF MEMORY OR OF THINKING.</h3>

<p><em>The first and principal thing the pupil requires to do in this lesson
after learning the definition of the following Three Laws&mdash;is to be able
to clearly understand the examples under each Law, and whether they
verify or illustrate that Law.</em></p>

between two words, or that there is a <em>prominent idea</em> or

few classes:&mdash;

<p>[In the case of the following pairs, one word has been so often
appropriated to the other, that there seems to be something in common in
the meaning of the terms&mdash;but it is not so, they are mere cases of
Concurrence, but of almost indissoluble Concurrence. For instance, a man
might examine a &ldquo;spade&rdquo; in all its parts and might even make one after a
model, and not even know what &ldquo;dig&rdquo; means. The mention of &ldquo;dig&rdquo; is as
likely to make us think of pickaxe as of spade. &ldquo;Spade&rdquo; does not mean
&ldquo;dig,&rdquo; nor does &ldquo;dig&rdquo; mean spade. &ldquo;Dig&rdquo; merely means the <em>action</em> of the
&ldquo;spade,&rdquo; or the <em>use</em> to which it is put. Hence this pair of words does
not furnish an example of Inclusion. But as &ldquo;dig&rdquo; is frequently
appropriated to &ldquo;spade&rdquo;&mdash;as we have often thought of those words
together&mdash;this is a case of strong Concurrence. The term &ldquo;swoop&rdquo; is
almost<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;5">&zwnj;</span><a name="p5" id="p5"></a> exclusively applied to &ldquo;eagle.&rdquo; A certain action or movement of
the eagle is termed swooping. But &ldquo;eagle&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;swoop,&rdquo; nor
does &ldquo;swoop&rdquo; mean &ldquo;eagle.&rdquo; We always think of &ldquo;eagle&rdquo; when we think of
&ldquo;swoop,&rdquo; but we do not often think of &ldquo;swoop&rdquo; when we think of &ldquo;eagle.&rdquo;
It is not <abbr title="Inclusion">In<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original omitted the period.">.</ins></abbr>, but <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original omitted the closing bracket.">]</ins></p>

</div>

<p class="after">If we examine the <em>meaning</em> of these two words&mdash;Building and Dwelling,
we find that both indicate <em>structures made by man</em>. This idea is
<em>common</em> to both. Now when we find that two words express the same
thought, either completely or partially, we say that it is a case of
Inclusion, because the pair of words contains or includes the same idea.
Inclusion is the first law of memory.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Inclusion. What variety have we here? Let us
see. Building applies to many kinds of structures; <em>house</em>, <em>stable</em>,
<em>church</em>, <em>depot</em>, <em>store</em>, etc. It is applicable to all of these in a
general way, but it designates none of them. But dwelling means a
<em>special</em> kind of structure&mdash;<em>a building occupied by man</em>&mdash;a place to
live in. This pair of words therefore illustrates Inclusion by Genus and
Species, indicated by the abridgement, <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> <abbr title="Genus">G.</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="Species">S.</abbr> or simply by <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>
Other examples: &ldquo;Planet, Mars;&rdquo; &ldquo;Mountain, Vesuvius;&rdquo; &ldquo;River,
Mississippi;&rdquo; &ldquo;Building Material, Potsdam Sandstone;&rdquo; &ldquo;Fruit, Peaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We may for convenience include in this class, cases of the Genus and the
<em>Individual</em> as &ldquo;Man and George Washington;&rdquo; &ldquo;Judge, <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> John Gibson;&rdquo;
&ldquo;New Yorker, <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> W.&nbsp;W. Astor;&rdquo; and cases of Species and the Individual,
as, &ldquo;Frenchman and Guizot;&rdquo; &ldquo;American, Abraham Lincoln.&rdquo; And also
Co-equal Species under a common Genus, as under &ldquo;Receiver&rdquo; we may
include &ldquo;Can&rdquo;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;7">&zwnj;</span><a name="p7" id="p7"></a> and &ldquo;Bin&rdquo;&mdash;under carnivorous birds we may include the
Eagle and the Hawk. &ldquo;Head-Covering, Hat, Cap;&rdquo; &ldquo;Hand-covering, Gloves,

several meanings. Here taken in connection with feathers, it means

abstract term that describes an attribute, but feathers are things and
therefore concrete. Hence the pair of words illustrate Inclusion by

<p>Now let the pupil read over very thoughtfully the ten words just
examined, and <em>recall</em> the <em>relation</em> which we found to exist between
every pair of them.</p>


<ul class="small">
<li><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;9">&zwnj;</span><a name="p9" id="p9"></a>Building.</li>
<li>Dwelling.</li>
<li>House.</li>
<li>Parlor.</li>
<li>Partridge.</li>
<li>Feathers.</li>
<li>Light.</li>
<li>Lighterman.</li>
<li>Lord Mansfield.</li>
<li>Fieldhand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having finished the reading, let the pupil close the lesson, or put it
out of sight and endeavour to recall the ten words from Building to
Fieldhand from memory. He will find no difficulty in doing so. He
learned the series by heart without any suspicion that he was committing
it to memory.</p>

<p>Now let him realise how he did this. It was because he made use of the
cementing Laws of the Memory. He sought out and found the relations
between the words. By <em>thinking</em> of those relations, he <em>exercised</em> his
intellect on those words in a double way&mdash;the <em>meaning</em> and the <em>sound</em>
of the words were considered and then the <em>similarities</em> of meaning and
of sound were noticed. A vivid <em>First Impression</em> was thus received from
the words themselves and from the relations between them and an easy and
certain recall thereby assured.</p>

<p>Now <em>recall</em> the series in an inverse order, beginning with &ldquo;Fieldhand,&rdquo;
and going back to &ldquo;Building.&rdquo; You do it easily, because each word was
cemented to its predecessor and its successor, and hence it makes no
difference whether you go forward or backward. When, however, you learn
by <em>rote</em> you know the task as you learned it, and not in the reverse
way. Before proceeding, repeat the ten words from memory, from
&ldquo;Building&rdquo; to &ldquo;Fieldhand,&rdquo; and the reverse way, at least five times;
each time, if possible, more rapidly than before. These repetitions are
not to <em>learn</em> the series; for this has been done already, but it is to
consolidate the effect of learning it in the right way.</p>

other Indian women. She knew who was meant when that name was applied to
her. But the name Pocahontas does not indicate that she was wise or
unwise, learned or unlearned, tall or short, old or young. In saving
the life of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> John Smith she became entitled to be called a &ldquo;<em>Good</em>
Princess.&rdquo;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;13">&zwnj;</span><a name="p13" id="p13"></a> In this case it would be <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by <abbr title="Genus">G.</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="Species">S.</abbr> We have heard of all
this, and now when we think of Pocahontas, we are apt to remember that
she was a good Princess for saving Smith&#8217;s life. The connection between
these words I call Concurrence. We have thought of these words together,
and the mind by its own operation has cemented them together, so that
when we think of one it is apt to make us remember the other.
<em>Concurrence means that which has been accidentally, or as cause and
effect, conjoined in our experience.</em> Between the words or ideas thus
conjoined, there is, strictly speaking, neither Inclusion or Exclusion.
Whenever there are unrelated things which the mind holds together simply
because it has occupied itself with them, then we have a case of
concurrence to be represented by <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> Other examples: &ldquo;Harrison,
Tippecanoe;&rdquo; &ldquo;Columbus, America;&rdquo; &ldquo;Washington, Cherry Tree;&rdquo; &ldquo;Andrew
Jackson, To the Victors belong the Spoils;&rdquo; &ldquo;Newton, Gravitation;&rdquo;

<p class="after">We have read the story of the rescue of Smith by Pocahontas. We have

apt to revive also the name of <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> John Smith and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>.
Another case:&mdash;A gentleman was present at Ford&#8217;s Theatre in Washington
when John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln. Just a moment before, he
recognised the odour of a hyacinth held by a lady in front of him. The
next moment he heard the fatal shot, and turning whence the report came,
he saw the murderous result. After the lapse of a quarter of a century,
he could not smell, see, or think of hyacinth without at once thinking
of that scene, nor could Lincoln&#8217;s assassination be mentioned in his
presence without his instantly thinking of hyacinth. Nothing could have
been more purely <em>accidental</em> than the quick succession of the sensation
of the odour and the murder of the President. But they were <em>experienced
together</em> or nearly together. They became cemented together, so that
the revival of one is apt to call up the other, and this is concurrence.</p>

<h3>REMARKS ON THE THREE LAWS.</h3>

<p>1. Since words have different meanings, we may sometimes find that a
pair of words exemplify all three Laws, as plough and sword. The
relation between them may be <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;16">&zwnj;</span><a name="p16" id="p16"></a> since both of them are <em>cutting</em>
instruments; one cuts and hacks human beings and the other cuts and
turns over the soil. It may be <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, in a metaphorical sense, as one is
the emblem of peace and the other of war, and it may be <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, as we have
<em>often thought of them together</em> as we read in the Bible of beating
swords into ploughshares.</p>

<p>2. Learning a series of words by heart by thinking of the <em>Relations</em>
between them is wholly unlike learning it by <em>rote</em>. In the latter case,
three or five words at a time or all ten words are read over from 10 to
20 times. This reading secures scarcely anything more than a <em>succession
of sights to the eye</em> or <em>sounds to the ear</em>. No <em>study</em> of the words is
required. The <em>action</em> of the <em>intellect</em> is not invoked. It is the
<em>mere sensuous</em> impression of Eye or Ear or both together that holds the
words together, and thus <em>many or endless</em> repetitions are required to
memorise a series which a <em>conscious thoughtful use of those Laws</em>
enables us to learn by <em>one painstaking</em> perusal.</p>

<p>Another way of learning such a series by <em>rote</em>, is to limit the
<em>extent</em> of the repetitions. Instead of reading over the entire series
or a large part of it many times, the series is slowly read over once or
several times <em>by pairs</em>, only two words at a time, but the method of
<em>acquirement</em> is precisely the same as in the former rote process. Let
us look at this last proceeding in detail. (1) It is usually applied
only where there is a <em>natural suggestiveness</em> between each pair of
words. (2) But no previous study is prescribed in regard to what
<em>constitutes</em> this suggestiveness, nor are the <em>varieties</em> of it set
forth and required to be mastered. (3) But above all, no <em>study</em> of the
<em>pairs of words themselves</em> is insisted upon. On the contrary, all such
study is emphatically deprecated. The mind is not allowed to be
<em>directed</em> to anything in <em>particular</em> in reading over the pairs. It
must be <em>left</em> without a <em>rudder</em> or guide to float wherever it listeth.
It is not to be &ldquo;interfered with&rdquo; by our will. What is this but
intellectual dawdling? A method of Vacuity pure and simple&mdash;the exact
opposite of Mental Assimilation. (4) If in reading over many times an
entire series, only the ear and eye are mainly affected and the
<em>intellect is left to wander</em>, much more must it wander here. In
running over many words, the intellect might be arrested by chance. But
here the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;17">&zwnj;</span><a name="p17" id="p17"></a> series consisting of two words only and all attempt to occupy
or engage the intellect being purposely avoided, and nothing being done
to enchain the attention to the consideration of the meaning or sounds
of the two words, or the <em>relation</em> between them, the intellect wanders
away from want of occupation. If when we wish to retain in our memories
a paragraph of fine sentiment or lucid reasoning, we find our attention
wanders, so it must wander here where only a pair of words is before it,
and we are not only not furnished with any tests or guides or stimulus
or motive for examining the words or for <em>finding the relation</em> between
them, but on the contrary we are forbidden to interfere with the
spontaneous action of the mind. The <em>intellect might be abolished</em> so
far as its <em>participation</em> in such an operation is concerned. What is
absorbed in such a case is absorbed intuitively and blindly. Hence we
see that what is accomplished by these two processes of <em>rote</em> learning
is weak impressions upon the memory and a distinct cultivation of mind
wandering.</p>

<p>This method of <em>rote</em> learning by pairs was invented and first taught by
Thomas Hallworth in New York in 1822. His method was adopted without
acknowledgment by Carl Otto in Germany and Austria, and his followers in
England and America.<a name="Anchor-A" id="Anchor-A"></a><a href="#Footnote-A" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote A."><span> Footnote </span>[A]</a></p>

<p>3. The opposite of these two methods of <em>rote</em> learning is my method,
which injects an <em>active process</em> between each pair of words. Each pair
of words is appraised and dovetailed by the Laws of Memory. And hence
the reader can notice the <em>fundamental difference</em> between all other
methods and mine. My method is to keep the mind in an <em>assimilating,
absorbing condition when trying to learn</em> by making the Intellect stay
with the Senses. In the process of <em>endless repetition</em> or learning by
<em>rote</em> as evinced in the two methods above given, the mind is in a
<em>passive</em> state. But when learning the above series by <em>my</em> method, it
was kept in an <em>active</em> state. The <em>intellect</em> was directed by the will
into certain<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;18">&zwnj;</span><a name="p18" id="p18"></a> channels and kept there. It was <em>searching</em> for what was
<em>in common</em> or <em>different</em> between the pairs of words. It was <em>noting</em>
points of likeness and classifying them. <em>This is thinking.</em> And the
most vivid <em>First Impressions</em> always result from the action of the
<em>intellect</em> upon the sensuous <em>stimuli</em> from ear and eye. <em>Intellectual
Assimilation</em> is a proper name for my methods.</p>

<p>4. The Three Laws are Forms or Modes of Mental Assimilation. But when
used <em>consciously</em> for any length of time, they operate much more
efficaciously than formerly&mdash;and they greatly increase the
Impressionability and Revivability&mdash;as any student can affirm who
faithfully carries out my instructions, and then his General Memory
becomes largely improved without a conscious use of my method.</p>


<h3>A TRAINING EXERCISE IN ATTENTION.</h3>

<p>Whoever wishes to increase his permanent Memory power and his power of
Attention must not omit to learn and practise the following exercise
<em>precisely as I prescribe</em>. He will experience great satisfaction in
carrying out my directions to the letter, because his conformity in this
and in other respects will bring the reward of a <strong class="smcap">new memory</strong> power almost
immediately. And if he were to disregard my directions, he will have no
one to blame but himself.</p>

<p>He must write down the first two words, &ldquo;Ice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Slippery,&rdquo; the latter
word under the former. Let him ascertain the exact relation between
these words. He will find that &ldquo;Ice&rdquo; is a concrete word, and &ldquo;Slippery&rdquo;
indicates a quality of &ldquo;Ice&rdquo; and of other things. He places opposite the
abbreviation <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, by <abbr title="Abstract and Concrete">A. and C.</abbr> In a similar way he proceeds to write
down one word at a time, and at once ascertaining its relation to the
previous word, and indicating that relation by the appropriate
abbreviation. When he has analysed ten words in this painstaking manner
he must recall them backward and forward from memory at least five
times, and each time faster than the other.</p>

<p>Let him deal with the next ten in a similar manner in all respects, and
then let him repeat the twenty words both ways at least five times, and
so on till he has analysed,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;19">&zwnj;</span><a name="p19" id="p19"></a> learned and recited the entire one hundred
words; and, finally, let him recite the one hundred words both ways at
least once a day for thirty days, in connection with the Building Series
and the Presidential Series and Series of English Sovereigns hereafter
given.</p>

<p>As the result of this Analysis and recitals, the pupil will make these
Laws of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> <em>operate hereafter in an unconscious manner</em>,
with a power a hundred-fold greater than before practising this method.</p>

<p>I occasionally find that a bright, highly-gifted person makes a poor
learner of my system, because he acts on hasty inferences of his own
instead of attending to my long-tried and never-failing methods. To
illustrate: Instead of <em>analysing the above series in pairs</em>, and
<em>discovering</em> and <em>noting</em> the <em>relation</em> between each pair as I
require, <em>he reads over the entire series</em>. His previous study of the
Memory Laws has, however, so impressed his mind with their influence
that he is able to retain this series after only two or three perusals.
Or, instead of reading over the entire series, he may even <i>slowly read
the series in pairs,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;20">&zwnj;</span><a name="p20" id="p20"></a> but without analysis, without trying to ascertain
and realise the exact relation between the words</i>. This is the method of
Vacuity or Dawdling formerly mentioned. But his study of the three Laws
in learning the Building Series has so sharpened and quickened his
appreciation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, that he <em>learned the one hundred
words in this wrong <em>way</em> very readily</em>.</p>

<p><em>But why should he not follow my directions?</em> Why not pursue my plan and
thereby acquire the <em>full power</em> of my system instead of the small
portion of that power gained by disregarding my direction? On the other
hand, pupils of only average natural ability are very apt to follow my
directions to the letter and thereby acquire an amount of Memory
Improvement which the above gifted, but non-complying pupil, seems
unable to understand.</p>

<p>If a person is afflicted with a <em>very</em> bad memory in any or all
respects, and particularly if this memory weakness is traceable to
<em>mind-wandering</em>, or if it co-exist with the latter infirmity, such a
person may find it best to make a series of from <em>one hundred to five
hundred words</em> on the model of the foregoing series, and learn the same
and <em>recite it daily both ways</em> for a month or more in addition to the
prescribed exercises, and if any trace of mind-wandering remain after
that, let him make and memorise another series of the same extent and
practise it for the same period. The <em>worst cases of mind-wandering</em> and
<em>of weak memories</em> always yield to this training treatment.</p>

<p>In like manner, but in much inferior degree, <em>the recital of what has
just been heard</em>, such as anecdotes, narratives, contents of plays,
lectures, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, not only tends to fix the recited matter in the memory,
but also to strengthen the memory generally, <em>provided the recital takes
place</em> shortly after the listening, as that is like a continuation of
the original experience. <a class="toclink" rel="contents" title="Contents." href="#CONTENTS">&larr;ToC</a></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="TRAINING-THE-INTELLECT" id="TRAINING-THE-INTELLECT"></a>TRAINING THE INTELLECT TO STAY WITH THE SENSES.</h2>

<p><em>Attention is the Will directing the Intellect into some particular
channel and keeping it there.</em> There are virtually two processes
involved in Attention. The Intellect is<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;21">&zwnj;</span><a name="p21" id="p21"></a> directed into a particular
channel, but to keep it there, all intruders must be excluded. To
illustrate. A student attempts to learn a proposition in Geometry. To do
this he must keep his mind on the printed explanations, and if his
thoughts attempt to fly away, he must repress that attempt. To guide his
mind into the channel of the printed exposition, he calls into play the
Directory power of the attention. To prevent intruders or extruders from
withdrawing his mind from the text, he exercises the Inhibitory function
of the Attention.</p>

<p>To fully understand what takes place when trying to study, let the pupil
recall that there are three sources of knowledge.</p>

<p>First: The Senses carry into his mind reports from the outside
world&mdash;Sensation&mdash;sight of the letters, words and sentences, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Second:
The Intellect operates on these undigested elementary Sense-reports, or
Sensations, and find <em>relations</em> among them. This is Perception, or
relations among Sensations. Third: The mind acts on the <em>perceived
relations</em> and finds relations among them. This is Reason or relations
among relations.</p>

<p>Now the geometrical student in reading the printed instructions to
himself or in reading them aloud, might simply occupy his <em>eye</em>, or <em>eye
and ear</em> with them and his Reason might soar away to other subjects,
climes or ages.</p>

<p>Remember that the Intellect is always active and busy, and the question
for us to answer in our own case is&mdash;shall it co-operate with the senses
or the matter before us, or shall it wander away?</p>

<p>What the geometrical student requires and what we all require in such
cases is to <em>compel the Intellect to stay with the Senses, and follow
the printed train of thought</em>.</p>

<p>Interest in the subject helps to secure this co-operation. And the
<em>Process or Method of study</em>, if it be an Assimilating one, also compels
this co-operation. And one of the processes which is most of all
effective in <strong class="smcap">training</strong> the Intellect to obey the Will and thereby to stay
with the Senses (where it is not a case of pure reflection), and thereby
to institute and develop the Habit of the activity of the Intellect
co-operating with the action of the mere senses, is practice in the use
of the Laws of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;22">&zwnj;</span><a name="p22" id="p22"></a> <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> To illustrate: In reciting the last
training example of one hundred words, the Directory power is exercised
and then the Inhibitory power is brought into play, and so on
<em>alternately</em>. Suppose the reciter has got to &ldquo;Signatures.&rdquo; If he does
not inhibit or exclude from his mind the word &ldquo;Petition&rdquo; he can make no
advance. If he dwells upon &ldquo;Petition&rdquo; he will never reach &ldquo;Cygnet.&rdquo; But
if he inhibits &ldquo;Petition&rdquo; his Directory power sends him on to &ldquo;Cygnet,&rdquo;
and then inhibiting &ldquo;Signatures&rdquo; he proceeds from &ldquo;Cygnet&rdquo; to &ldquo;Net,&rdquo;
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In this most simple, elementary way he exercises and trains the
Directory and Inhibitory functions to co-operate in recalling the entire
Series, and notice how many distinct and separate times he has exerted
the Directory function and how many times the Inhibitory function in
reciting a short series. And if <em>he has learned</em> this and other Series
<em>as I direct</em> and then <em>recites them forward and backward as long as I
require</em>, he is sure to greatly strengthen his Attention and thereby
habituate the intellect to stay with the senses and thereby help to
banish mind-wandering. And when the Intellect is thus trained into the
Habit of staying with the sense of sight or hearing in reading or
listening, the geometrical or other student can keep his mind on the
subject before him until it is mastered.</p>


<h3>IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF ANALYSIS.</h3>

Names, the whole or part of which are <em>entirely new</em> to us, as a list of
members of a committee, a series of facts in science, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> We can usually
do this by Analysis.</p>

<p>Recollective Analysis, or Analysis for the purpose of helping to learn
by heart, is not an originating or <em>manufacturing</em> process. It simply
<em>finds</em> relation <em>already existing</em> between the words or the ideas which
the words suggest or evoke. But where there is <em>no existing relation</em>
between the words or ideas, it is a case for Synthesis, to be taught
hereafter.</p>

<p>The highest Analysis relates to <em>objects</em>, or rather to the <em>ideas</em> we
have of them, and the lowest to <em>mere words</em>, to<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;23">&zwnj;</span><a name="p23" id="p23"></a> mere articulated
sounds, or their written or printed representatives. The great body of
examples and illustrations in my lessons pertain to ideas; but in the
list of twenty-four Presidents I deal with the proper Names as words
only, as words or articulated sounds&mdash;words which are nearly devoid of
meaning except as marks or sounds for naming persons, or as words
containing syllables which may have a general meaning in other
applications. I need scarcely add that the Laws of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>
apply to words merely as well as to the ideas which are, of course,
suggested by the words. Let me illustrate: Ulysses S. Grant was
succeeded by Rutherford B. Hayes. The initial syllables of Ulysses and
of Rutherford make an inclusion by sound. The &ldquo;U&rdquo; of Ulysses is
pronounced as if spelled &ldquo;You.&rdquo; We then have in effect &ldquo;You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ru,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;&mdash;when we are supposed to pronounce the &ldquo;u&rdquo; in Ruth
as a long &ldquo;u;&rdquo; but if it be considered to be a short sound of &ldquo;u,&rdquo; it is
only a weak case of <abbr title="Inclusion by sound.">In. by s.</abbr> But if the pupil shuts his eyes, such
inclusions will not be observed. It is true that such application is not
so high or grand as when they govern ideas, but it is equally <em>genuine</em>.
It is only a lower stratum, but still it is a part of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>, and
on no account is it to be ignored.</p>

<p><em>Ideas are never words</em> nor are <em>words ever ideas</em>, but words become so
<em>associated</em> with ideas by habit, or by the Law of Concurrence, that
they <em>arouse certain ideas</em> whenever they are used. They are used as
<em>signs</em> of ideas&mdash;as the means of communicating them. There is rarely,
if ever, any <em>necessary</em> connection that we can discover between a
particular idea and the word used to stand for it. Not only do different
nations use different <em>words</em> or <em>sounds</em> to arouse the <em>same</em> thought,
but different words in the same language are sometimes used to portray
practically <em>the same idea</em>, as in the case of Mariner, Sailor, Seaman,
Jack Tar, Navigator, Skipper, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Nor is this all&mdash;the <em>same sound</em>
may awaken different ideas, as &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eye.&rdquo; In the first case &ldquo;I&rdquo;
stands for the person using it, and in the last case it means the organ
of sight. To the eyesight they are obviously unlike. It may be well to
remark that in imposing a name in the first place, <em>a reason</em> may exist
why<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;24">&zwnj;</span><a name="p24" id="p24"></a> that name is given, as Albus (white) was given to the mountains, now
more euphoniously called Alps, because they were white or snow-crowned;
but Alps does not <em>mean</em> white to the moderns. The word now merely
indicates or points out the mountains so called. A word may survive and
take a new meaning after its original meaning is no longer
ascertainable.</p>

<p>The <em>context</em> helps us to know which meaning of the word was intended
when the word is spoken, and the context and spelling tell the same
thing when writing or print is used. Take the words &ldquo;Hounds, Bark.&rdquo; Here
Bark means the cry or yelp of the dogs. But in &ldquo;Tree, Bark,&rdquo; the Bark of
the tree is suggested. Yet the word Bark is spelled precisely the same
in both cases. The word spelled &ldquo;Bark&rdquo; is really used to express two
different things and the context generally tells which is meant in any
particular case.</p>

<p>Individual <em>letters</em> become so strongly associated with a particular
meaning that although the vocal value is exactly the same, yet the one
spelling goes to one man and the other to a different man. &ldquo;Spenser&rdquo;
would never suggest to a learned man the author of the &ldquo;Philosophy of
Evolution,&rdquo; nor would &ldquo;Spencer&rdquo; ever suggest the author of the &ldquo;Fairie
Queen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Mil&rdquo; would never mean &ldquo;John Stuart Mill,&rdquo; although the
words &ldquo;Mil&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mill&rdquo; are pronounced exactly alike. We sometimes cannot
recall a Proper Name, yet we feel sure that it begins or ends with S or
K or L, or that a certain other letter is in the middle of the word. We
usually find that we were right. In these cases <em>our clue to the entire
word was found in only one letter of it</em>.</p>

<p>Noticing that the <em>same letter is in common to two words</em>, although <em>all
the other letters may be different</em>, is one case of Inclusion by
spelling. Take an example: President John Tyler was followed by
President James K. Polk. Analyse the two names&mdash;Tyler and Polk. The
letter &ldquo;l&rdquo; alone is common to the two names. Here is one <em>letter</em> found
in totally unlike contexts. If this fact is <em>noticed</em>, it cannot but
help hold those two names together. The exercise of learning the names
of the twenty-four Presidents is a good one for this purpose. It has a
<em>training</em> value entirely apart<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;25">&zwnj;</span><a name="p25" id="p25"></a> from its practical value in that case.
And I give it for its <em>training</em> value alone.</p>

<p>It is infinitely better for him to learn by analysis the <em>order</em> of the
Presidents than to learn that order by the only other method the pupil
has heretofore known, viz., <em>endless repetition</em>. When the pupil thinks
a relation may be weak, let him consider that a weak relation <em>thought
about</em> is a hundred-fold stronger than <em>mere</em> repetition <em>without any
thinking at all</em>. It is either <em>thoughtless</em> repetition, or <em>thoughtful
Analysis</em> that he must use. <a class="toclink" rel="contents" title="Contents." href="#CONTENTS">&larr;ToC</a></p>

<h2><a name="HOW-TO-LEARN-PROPER-NAMES" id="HOW-TO-LEARN-PROPER-NAMES"></a>HOW TO LEARN PROPER NAMES IN A CERTAIN ORDER OF SUCCESSION.</h2>


<p>The true way to learn such lists as those of the Popes of Rome, the
Kings of England and of the American Presidents is to learn them in
their places in History, as parts of the Historical order of events to
which they belong, as facts in the chain of causes and effects.</p>

<p>Their Terms, Administrations, or Reigns are, however, used by historians
as landmarks, and to follow the historians to the best advantage, it may
be desirable to know the series as such, as a useful preparation for the
study of the Times and age. But whatever the advantages of knowing the
order of the American Presidents, I deal with it here <em>solely</em> for the
<em>training</em> effect in Analysis and as an example of a method of dealing
with any list of <em>mere</em> names.</p>

<p>The mode of dealing with this Presidential series will show how all
similar Series may be handled during the period of the pupil&#8217;s training.
I divide the series or list of the twenty-four American Presidents into
three Groups: the first Group containing <em>seven</em> names, the second
having <em>eight</em> names, and the third having <em>nine</em> names. The number of
names in each Group is easily remembered: 7, 8 and 9.</p>

<p>The first Group contains the names of</p>

<ul class="smcap small">
<li>George Washington,</li>
<li>John Adams,</li>
<li>Thomas Jefferson,</li>
<li>James Madison,</li>
<li>James Monroe,</li>
<li>John Q. Adams,</li>
<li>Andrew Jackson.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;26">&zwnj;</span><a name="p26" id="p26"></a>If the student has mastered the previous exercises, he ought to be able
to analyse this Group of names with the greatest ease. Let him try, and
if he fail, then let him study my Analysis as given below. Points of
Analysis that appear weak to me may be strong for him, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>.
At all events, let him if possible learn each of the three Groups by his
own Analysis, looking at my work afterwards.</p>

<p>Now let the pupil repeat from memory the series from George Washington
to Andrew Jackson at least five times, each time recalling and
realizing how each pair of names was linked together. After this let the
list be recalled<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;27">&zwnj;</span><a name="p27" id="p27"></a> several times forward and backward, and more rapidly
each time, without recalling the analysis.</p>


<h4>Remarks.</h4>

<p>1. This group may well be termed the &ldquo;Long-Term Group,&rdquo; since all of the
seven Presidents except John Adams and his son, John Q. Adams, served
two terms.</p>

<p>2. Three of the members of this group died after the close of their
terms of office, on the <em>natal day</em> of the Republic, viz., John Adams
and Thomas Jefferson, on the <em>4th of July</em>, 1826, and James Monroe on
the <em>4th of July</em>, 1831.</p>

<p>3. This group also might be called the &ldquo;J&rdquo; group, since the initial
letter of the Christian name or surname of every member of it begins
with &ldquo;J&rdquo; or its phonetic equivalent, soft G, as <i>G</i>eorge Washington,
<i>J</i>ohn Adams, Thomas <i>J</i>efferson, <i>J</i>ames Madison, <i>J</i>ames Monroe,
<i>J</i>ohn Q. Adams, and Andrew <i>J</i>ackson.</p>

<h4>Remarks.</h4>

<p>1. This may be called the &ldquo;Single Term Group,&rdquo; since none of the group
served more than one term.</p>

<p>2. The group is notable for the fact that it is the only one in which
two Presidents (William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor) died

<h4>Remarks.</h4>

<p>1. This group furnishes the notable fact that two Presidents (Lincoln
and Garfield) were assassinated while in office.</p>

<p>2. Another peculiarity of this group is that, for the first time since
the days of Washington, there was a widespread discussion and effort
made to push the claims of a President (Grant) for a third term.</p>

<p>3. This group contains the name of the grandson (Benjamin Harrison) of
William Henry Harrison, of the second group. The only other instance of
relationship between the Presidents was in the case of John Adams and
his son, John Quincy Adams of the first group.</p>

<p>4. This group contains the name of the only President (Andrew Johnson)
who was ever sought to be impeached. The prosecution failed to convict,
having lacked one vote of the number necessary for a conviction.</p>

<p>5. Grover Cleveland affords the first instance where the two terms of a
President are separated by the full term of another President (Benjamin
Harrison). <a class="toclink" rel="contents" title="Contents." href="#CONTENTS">&larr;ToC</a></p>

<h2><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;31">&zwnj;</span><a name="p31" id="p31"></a><a name="ENGLISH-SOVEREIGNS" id="ENGLISH-SOVEREIGNS"></a>ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS.
<br />
<small>A UNIQUE EXERCISE.</small></h2>


<p>The method here used of memorising the order of the English sovereigns
from William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, the Conqueror, to Victoria possesses the following
novelties:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) We learn the order of the entire series of thirty-seven sovereigns
by means of the relations, direct and indirect, which we establish with
the reigning sovereign, Victoria.</p>

<p>(2) The precise credit is claimed for this method which it is entitled
to receive. In a list of proper names we sometimes have several surnames
alike, with usually a difference of Christian names, as in the
presidential series we have&mdash;<em>William Henry</em> Harrison and <em>Benjamin</em>
Harrison, and <em>John</em> Adams and <em>John Quincy</em> Adams, and we also
sometimes have the same Christian names prefixed to different surnames,
as James <em>Madison</em> and James <em>Monroe</em>. But in the Sovereigns of England,
from William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> to Victoria, we have many Christian names alike, and the
differences indicated by <em>ordinal</em> numbers, as George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>,
George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr> This order of the English Kings is most
extraordinary, neither the Popes of Rome, nor the French, nor any other
list of kings, furnishing any parallel in more than a few incidents. It
is these unique coincidences and recurrences that make it so easy to
find relations between these sovereigns. This method is not applicable
to the American Presidents, Prime Ministers of England, or hardly any
other series.</p>

<p>(3) No accidental relations of parts of names is resorted to, as was
done in the case of the American Presidents.</p>

<p>(4) The series is so taught that it can be recited forwards<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;32">&zwnj;</span><a name="p32" id="p32"></a> and
backwards&mdash;the only true test of learning any series.</p>

<p>(5) The series is completely worked out and nothing is left to chance or
possible mistakes so liable to be committed by novices in dealing for
the first time with a new process that has to be applied to many
details.</p>

<p>(6) When the series is carefully studied and the relations painstakingly
<em>characterised</em>, it is quickly learned and it is hard to forget.</p>

<p>(7) When the series is learned by this method and the relations are
occasionally reviewed and <em>identified</em>, its recital both ways once or
twice a day for a month helps to develop the Attention as well as the
Assimilative powers.</p>

<p>(8) The <em>exact name</em> of each Sovereign is learned. The student relies on
real relations and names, and not on unidentified jingles of threes and
threes and twos and twos, like three Edwards and three Henrys and two
Edwards and two Henrys, with the inevitable necessity of having
afterwards to learn <em>which</em> Edward and <em>which</em> Henry was meant, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> But
summations can follow specifications.</p>

<p>(9) Pestalozzi [1745&ndash;1827] taught that we must proceed from the &ldquo;known&rdquo;
to the &ldquo;unknown;&rdquo; but this principle mainly applies to learning the
words of a foreign language. When we begin to learn such words they are
wholly unknown to us. But in learning ordinary series of names or prose
or poetry by heart, all the names and words used may be equally well
known by us; but it is mainly the <em>order</em> in which these occur that we
wish to memorise, and we begin at the beginning and proceed as we learn
on from the Better Known or Best Known. In the list of American
Presidents the series extends back to a little more than a century; but
in the case of the English Sovereigns, when we begin with the Conqueror,
the series extends back to 1066&mdash;upwards of 800 years&mdash;and, although in
such a series the names of all the Sovereigns may be known, yet the
latest is vastly better known to us than the earliest. In such a case it
may be most useful to begin with the Best Known.</p>

<p>(10) Fortunately in this case the Best Known Sovereign is a <strong class="smcap">pivot</strong>
around which all the other Sovereigns are directly or indirectly
related. <em>How</em>, we will proceed to show.<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;33">&zwnj;</span><a name="p33" id="p33"></a> Something of the method will be

<p>We begin with the Best Known, or Victoria, and we take note that she is
an independent Queen, since she has never shared sovereignty with
anyone; but Mary, of &ldquo;William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and Mary,&rdquo; was not an independent
Queen, because she did share the Sovereign Power with her husband.
Hereafter, when I use the word Queen I mean an independent Queen, except
when Mary, of &ldquo;William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and Mary,&rdquo; is mentioned, and her name will
be used only in Connection with William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> England has had only four
independent Queens, namely, Mary [Tudor], Elizabeth, Anne, and Victoria.</p>

<p>(<abbr title="1.">I.</abbr>) Victoria is the <em>last</em> queen and Mary was the <em>first</em> queen
[Exclusion between <em>first</em> and <em>last</em>, or <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>], and Mary, <em>first</em> queen,
was preceded by the <em>last</em> Edward, or Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr> [<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>] And Mary, the
<em>first</em> queen, was followed by the the <em>first</em> and only Elizabeth [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>]
And the <em>first</em> and only Elizabeth was followed by James the <em>First</em>, or
I. [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>] Again, <em>Queen</em> Elizabeth was followed by <em>King</em> James, making
a clear case of <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> Again, Anne, the <em>third</em> queen, was preceded by <abbr title="William">Wm.</abbr>
the <em>Third</em>, or III., and Mary [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>]<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;34">&zwnj;</span><a name="p34" id="p34"></a> And these <em>two</em> co-equal Sovereigns
were preceded by James the <em>Second</em>, or II. [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, between cardinal
number <em>two</em> and the ordinal number <em>Second</em>]. This series of Queens
concludes with Victoria the <em>fourth</em> Queen, who was preceded by William
the <em>Fourth</em>, or IV. [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>], and William the <em>Fourth</em>, or IV., was
preceded by George the <em>Fourth</em>, or IV. [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>]; and George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr> by
George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, and he by George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, and he by George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>,&mdash;a concurrence
reversed, and William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr> was preceded, as we have seen, by William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>
and Mary&mdash;and William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> by William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, and William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> at the very
beginning of the series&mdash;<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>Now let us recall in the forward and reverse order what we have learned
so far. William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, Mary, Elizabeth, James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>,
James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and Mary, Anne, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>,
George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, and Victoria, and the order
reversed is Victoria, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>,
George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Anne, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and Mary, James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Elizabeth,
Mary, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr></p>

<p>(<abbr title="2.">II.</abbr>) Disregarding for the moment the four periods of what is usually
called the Commonwealth, we see that between Elizabeth and William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>
and Mary, are four monarchs, the two James and the two Charles. We have
already learned that Elizabeth was followed by James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> and that
William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and Mary were preceded by James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> Hence we see that the
two Charles must come <em>between</em> the two James, and, of course, that
Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> must precede Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, and that the order of these four
monarchs <em>must</em> be James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, and James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>&mdash;a
plain case of <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> reversed. We saw that there were two of these four
monarchs before the Commonwealth; there must then be two after it,
making James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> and Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> before the Commonwealth and Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>
and James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> after it.</p>

<p>On the day that Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> was executed (January&nbsp;30, 1649), the
Parliament (the House of Commons) abolished the kingly office and House
of Lords, and appointed a Council of State of 41 members, which with the
House of Commons was to be the government. Intermediate then between
Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> and Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> there came&mdash;</p>

<ul class="small">
<li><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;35">&zwnj;</span><a name="p35" id="p35"></a>Council of State and Parliament.</li>
<li>Oliver Cromwell.</li>
<li>Richard Cromwell.</li>
<li>Council of State and Parliament.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we see there was a Council of State and Parliament at the beginning
and close of these intermediates, and between them came Oliver Cromwell
and his son, Richard Cromwell. Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, followed by Council of State
and Parliament, made a case of Exclusion and the Council of State and
Parliament, followed by the Protector Oliver Cromwell, gives another
example of <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> and a case of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> between Oliver Cromwell and his son
Richard, who inherited the protectorate, but a case of <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> again between
the powerful Oliver and his weak son Richard, and another example of <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>
between the protectorate of Richard Cromwell and the Council of State
and Parliament, and another between the latter and the full-fledged
monarchy of Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr></p>

<p>Now review what we have learned so far and we have William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>,
William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, Mary, Elizabeth, James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Council
of State and Parliament, Oliver Cromwell, Richard Cromwell, Council of
State and Parliament, Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and Mary,
Anne, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, and
Victoria. Reverse the recital and we have Victoria, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>,
George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, George&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Anne, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> and
Mary, James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Council of State and Parliament, Richard
Cromwell, Oliver Cromwell, Council of State and Parliament, Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>,
James&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Elizabeth, Mary, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, and William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr></p>

<p>(<abbr title="3.">III.</abbr>) We now proceed to learn the eighteen kings intermediate between
William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> and Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr> We notice at once that the <em>first</em> and <em>last</em>
of these intermediates are the <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> Henrys [<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>], viz.,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> and Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 8th">VIII.</abbr> We see also that Henry the <em>First</em>, or I., is
followed by Henry the Second, or II. [<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>], with the <em>first</em> and only
Stephen as the <em>first</em> single intermediary [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>]. Returning to
Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, we see that he, the <em>last</em> Edward, is preceded by
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 8th">VIII.</abbr>, or the <em>last</em> Henry [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>] We also notice that Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr> is
preceded by Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, and<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;36">&zwnj;</span><a name="p36" id="p36"></a> Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr> by Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, or the half of six
[<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by <abbr title="Whole and Part">W. and P.</abbr>]. Finally we observe that between William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> and
Mary, there are three series of kings completed&mdash;eight Henrys, six
Edwards, and three Richards. Making the three Richards <em>reference</em>
points we can easily fix the residue of the eighteen kings for we see
that Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> or the <em>First</em>, is preceded by Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> and followed by
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, with the <em>first</em> and only John as the <em>second</em> single
intermediary [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>] and that Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr> is preceded by Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>,
Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, and Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, or three Edwards, and followed by
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 5th">V.</abbr>, and Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, or three Henrys, and that
Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr> is preceded by Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr> and Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 5th">V.</abbr>, or two Edwards,
and followed by Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 7th">VII.</abbr> and Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 8th">VIII.</abbr>, or two Henrys.</p>

<p>Recalling the succession from William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> to Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, we have
William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Stephen, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, John,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 5th">V.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 5th">V.</abbr>, Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 7th">VII.</abbr>,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 8th">VIII.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr> Reversing the order, we have Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 8th">VIII.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 7th">VII.</abbr>, Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 5th">V.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 6th">VI.</abbr>,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 5th">V.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 4th">IV.</abbr>, Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Edward&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>,
Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 3rd">III.</abbr>, John, Richard&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>, Stephen, Henry&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>, William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 2nd">II.</abbr>,
and William&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr></p>

<small>HOW TO NEVER FORGET FIGURES AND DATES.</small></h2>


<p>When my pupils have gained the quick perception and instantaneous
apprehension which always reward the studious use of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>,
they can, amongst other new achievements, always remember and never
forget figures and dates.</p>

<p><em>Pike&#8217;s Peak</em>, the most famous in the chain known as the Rocky Mountains
in America, is fourteen thousand one hundred and forty-seven feet high.
Instantly, one who is trained in the use of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>,
perceives that there are two fourteens [<abbr title="Synonymous Inclusion">Syn. In.</abbr>] in these figures, and
that the last figure is half of fourteen, or 7 <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by <abbr title="Whole and Part">W. and P.</abbr>, making
14,147. Of course, one who is not practised in analogies, in discovering
similarities and finding differences would not have noticed any
peculiarity in these figures which would enable him to remember them.
Few people ever notice any relations among numbers. But any possible
figures or dates always possess relations to the mind trained in <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>,
<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p><em>Fujiyama</em>, the noted volcano of Japan, is twelve thousand three hundred
and sixty-five feet high. Does any pupil who has mastered the first
lesson and who is expert in the use of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, fail to
notice that here we have the disguised statement that the height of this
mountain is expressed in the number of months and days of the year,
12,365&nbsp;feet high? These figures drop into that mould and henceforth are
remembered without difficulty. These are remarkable coincidences no
doubt, but are not all sets of figures similarly impressive
coincidences to the trained eye, and the <em>active</em>, <em>thinking</em> and
<em>assimilative</em> mind?</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;39">&zwnj;</span><a name="p39" id="p39"></a>No reader of English history has failed to notice the three sixes in the
date of the Great Fire in London, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i>, 1666. The &ldquo;three sixes&rdquo; are
generally resorted to as a signal for fire companies to turn out in full
force; yet such a coincidence of figures in a distant date makes a
slight impression compared to the vividness of events that happened in
the year of our birth, the year of graduation from school, the year of
marriage, and the year of the death of relatives, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Keep a small
blank book for such entries, not to help remember the dates or facts,
but to have them together so as to rapidly deal with them, to classify
them and otherwise study them under the eye. You will soon be astonished
at the accumulation.</p>

<p>The population of New Zealand, exclusive of natives, is 672,265.
Bringing the first two figures into relation with the last two we have
67 and 65&mdash;a difference of 2 only. The two groups of 672 and 265 have
the figure&nbsp;2 at the end of the first group, and another 2 at the
beginning of the second group. These two twos are in sequence (<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>),
and each of them expresses the difference between 67 and 65. <em>Thought</em>
about in this way, or in any other, the series becomes fixed in mind,
and will be hard to forget.</p>

<p>The population of Sydney is 386,400. Here are two groups of three
figures each. The first two figures of the first group are 38, and the
first two figures of the second group are 40&mdash;a difference of 2. Two
taken from 8 leaves 6, or the third figure of the first group, and 2
added to the first figure of the second group makes 6. The 40 ends with
a cypher, and it is a case of <abbr title="Synonymous Inclusion">Syn. In.</abbr> that the last figure of the
second group or the third figure of it should likewise be a cypher.
Besides, those who know anything at all about the population of Sydney
must know that it is vastly more than 38,640, and hence that there must
be another cypher after 40, making the total of 386,400.</p>

<p>The population of Melbourne is 490,912. Here we have 4 at the beginning
and half of 4 or 2 at the end of the six figures. The four interior
figures, viz., 9091 is a clear case of <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>&mdash;or 90 and 91. Then again 91
ending with 1, the next figure is 2&mdash;a case of sequence or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> But
490,912 is the population of the city of Melbourne with its suburbs. The
&ldquo;city&rdquo; itself contains only 73,361 inhabitants,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;40">&zwnj;</span><a name="p40" id="p40"></a> 73 reversed becomes
37&mdash;or only 1 more than 36. This 1 placed at the end of or after 36
makes the 361. Now 37 reversed is 73, and then follows 361, making the
total to be 73,361.</p>

<p>Let the attentive pupil observe that this method does not give any set
of rules for thinking in the same manner in regard to different sets or
example of numbers. That would be impossible. Thinking or finding
relations amongst the objects of thought must be differently worked out
in each case, since the figures themselves are differently grouped.</p>

<p>The foregoing cases in regard to population will suffice for those who
live in the Australian colonies, and to others they will teach the
method of handling such cases, and leave them the pleasure of working
out the process in regard to the population where they reside, or other
application of the method they may wish to make.</p>

<p>Great encouragement is found in the circumstance that after considerable
practice in dealing with numerous figures through <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>,
new figures are self-remembered from the habit of assimilating numbers.
They henceforth make more vivid impressions than formerly.</p>

<p>A little practice makes the pupil prompt in dealing with any figures
whatever. Take the height of Mount Everest, which is 29,002&nbsp;feet. We
have all heard that it is more than five miles high. Let us test this
statement. There are 5,280&nbsp;feet in a mile, multiply 5,280 by 5, and we
have 26,400. Hence we see that Mount Everest being 29,002&nbsp;feet high must
be more than five miles high. Half of a mile is 5,280&nbsp;feet divided by 2,
or 2,640&nbsp;feet. Add this to 26,400 and we have 29,040. Hence we see that
Mount Everest is <abbr title="5 and a half">5&frac12;</abbr>&nbsp;miles high lacking 38&nbsp;feet, or that if we add
38&nbsp;feet to its height of 29,002, it would then be exactly <abbr title="5 and a half">5&frac12;</abbr>&nbsp;miles high.
Can we then forget that it is exactly 29,002&nbsp;feet high?</p>

<p>Shakespeare was born in 1564 and died in 1616. The First Folio Edition
of his works was printed in 1623, the Second in 1632, the Third in
1664, and the Fourth in 1685. Can we fix these events infallibly in our
memories?<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;43">&zwnj;</span><a name="p43" id="p43"></a> We can begin with whichever date we prefer. If we add together
the figures of the year of his birth, 1564, they make 16. All the dates
hereafter considered occurred in 1600, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> We can thus disregard the
first 16 and consider only the last two figures which constitute the
fraction of a century.</p>

<p>Let us begin with his death in 1616 in the <em>sixteens</em>. Is not this a
vivid collocation of figures? Can we forget it as applied to the great
dramatist? Now if we double the last 16, it gives us the date of the
second Folio in [16]32 and 32 reversed gives us the date of the first
Folio. Again, seven years after his death [&ldquo;seven ages of man&rdquo;] his
first Folio was published in 1623. The second Folio was published in
1632 or 23 reversed, and the third Folio in 1664, or 32 doubled, and
just 100 years after his birth in 1564. His birth might also be
remembered as occurring in the same year as that of the great astronomer
Galileo. The fourth Folio appeared in 1685 or 21&nbsp;years after the third
Folio. This period measures the years that bring man&#8217;s majority or full
age.</p>

<p>Attention to the facts of reading will be secured by increased power of
Concentration, and a familiarity with <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> will enable us
to assimilate all dates and figures by numeric thinking with the
greatest promptitude, especially the longer or larger series.</p>

<p>Try the case of Noah&#8217;s Flood, 2348&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> Here the figures pass by a unit
at a time from 2[3] to 4, and then by doubling the 4 we have the last
figure 8&mdash;making altogether 2348. Another method of dealing with this
date is very instructive. Read the account in <abbr title="Genesis chapter 7 verses 9, 13 and 15.">Gen. ch.&nbsp;vii., vv. 9, 13,
and 15.</abbr> Now we can proceed.</p>

<p>They went into the Ark by <em>twos</em>. This gives the figure 2. Now let us
find the other figures. Noah&#8217;s three sons and their wives make three
pairs of persons, or <em>three</em> families. This gives the second figure 3.
Then counting Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their wives,
there were four pairs of human beings altogether. This gives the figure
4. Finally the total number of human beings who entered the ark were
4&nbsp;pairs or <em>eight</em> persons. This gives the figure 8. Thus we have the
entire set of figures, 2348&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> Take the date of the creation according<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;44">&zwnj;</span><a name="p44" id="p44"></a>
to the accepted biblical chronology as 4004&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> We could say the date
has <em>four</em> figures, that the expression of it begins and ends with the
figure 4, and that the two intermediates are nought, or cyphers; or that
the figures are expressed by 40 and <em>forty reversed</em> as 40-04&mdash;or 4004.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">A Scientific Experiment.</h3>

<p>Having met several persons who claimed that they always remembered
figures by reasoning about them [whatever that may have meant], and yet
all such persons having shown an inability to remember many dates or
numbers, I inferred that they were honestly mistaken in supposing that
they could remember numbers, or else that such a method was not adapted
to their idiosyncrasies. At that time, I did not suspect that their
failure may have arisen from lack of <em>training</em> in <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>
From the circumstance that I myself could use this method with
promptitude and certainty, I determined to test it in a strictly
scientific way.</p>

<p>I made the experiment two years ago, and all my experience since has
corroborated the conclusion then arrived at.</p>

<p>I experimented with the two groups of 20 pupils each. Neither knew any
method of dealing with dates and numbers. The first group had had no
training in <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>; the second group had been well practised
in those laws. I then gave each member of each group several very
difficult cases of dates and numbers to be memorised&mdash;one example
containing 24 figures. To save time and space in exposition, I have
heretofore only mentioned 12 figures, or the half of the amount. All of
the first group failed except one. He, however, could not memorise the
24 figures. All of the second group handled all the new examples with
success, and only two of them met with much difficulty in dealing with
the 24 figures.</p>

<p>Since this decisive experiment, I have heartily recommended the method
of finding relations amongst the numbers themselves, to all who are
proficient in the use of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>The example of 24 figures must conclude this exposition.<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;45">&zwnj;</span><a name="p45" id="p45"></a> They represent
respectively the number of the day of the month in which the first
Saturday in each month falls in 1895 and 1896. To one without practice
in applying analysis to figures, there seems no hope of memorising this
long group of figures except by endless repetition. The 24 figures are</p>

<p class="center">
522641637527417426415375.
</p>

<p>Yet reflect a moment and all will be clear. Divide the 24 figures into 2
groups of 12 figures each and number the first group, divided into four
sections, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The first 12 figures, grouped in threes.">
<tr><th>(1)</th><th>(2)</th><th>(3)</th><th>(4)</th></tr>
<tr><td>522,</td><td>641,</td><td>637,</td><td>527.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now bring the first and fourth groups into relation, and you see at once
that the fourth group is larger than the first group by only <em>five</em>.
Bringing the <em>second</em> group into relation with the <em>third</em> group, we
find they differ only by <em>four</em>. Again: the third group is larger than
the fourth by 100 and by 10, that is 527 becomes 637, the seven alone
remaining steadfast. Beginning with the fourth group and passing to the
third group we have the fourth group with 110 added. The second group is
the third group with only four added, and the first group is the fourth
group with only five subtracted. Thinking out these relations you can
recall the groups as groups or the separate figures of each group or the
entire 12 figures either forwards or backwards&mdash;and you have achieved
this result by <em>Attention</em> and <em>Thought</em>.</p>

<p>The other twelve figures are easily disposed of. They are 417426415375.
Divided into groups of three figures each we have</p>

<table summary="The second 12 figures, grouped in threes.">
<tr><th>(1)</th><th>(2)</th><th>(3)</th><th>(4)</th></tr>
<tr><td>417</td><td>426</td><td>415</td><td>375<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original omitted this period.">.</ins></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Bringing the first group into relation with the third group, we notice
that it is larger by two&mdash;and considering the second group with the
fourth group, we find that the second group is as much and one more
above 400 as the fourth is below 400. Other minor matters could be
noticed, as that the first two figures of each group are respectively
41&mdash;42&mdash;41&mdash;37, and that the last figure in each group is 7&mdash;6&mdash;5&mdash;5.
But these relations are hardly worth observing.</p>

<p>Coming back to the first series, we know that each figure represents
the number of the day of the month to which it belongs on which the
first Saturday in that month falls.<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;46">&zwnj;</span><a name="p46" id="p46"></a> The figures for 1895 are
522&mdash;641&mdash;637&mdash;527. The first Saturday in January, 1895, falls on the
<em>fifth</em> day of January, hence the second Saturday must be 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;= the
12th day of January; the third Saturday the 19th, and the fourth
Saturday 26th. It is easy to know on what day of the <em>week</em> any day in
January falls. Suppose you ask on what week day the 25th of January
falls? You know the 26th is Saturday, and hence the 25th must be the day
preceding the 26th, to wit, Friday, the 25th. Suppose you ask on what
week day the 9th of January falls. You know the 12th is Saturday (the
second Saturday). You now count backward thus: 12 is Saturday, 11 must
be Friday, 10 Thursday, 9 must be Wednesday. The <em>first</em> Saturday in
January, 1895, is the 5th; of February, the 2nd; of March, the 2nd; of
April, the 6th; of May, the 4th, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> And we can tell on what week
day any day of any of the other months falls.</p>

<h3>THE ANALYTIC SYNTHETIC METHOD APPLIED TO LONG SENTENCES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> <em>unobservant</em> and wholly <em>unreliant</em> many pupils are may be seen
from the fact that notwithstanding my elaborate handling of the
processes of learning prose and poetry by heart, I often receive
requests to send some indication of how I would learn a particular
chapter or selection by heart! But a chapter consists of paragraphs and
paragraphs of sentences. Learning the desired passages by heart is done
by applying the methods here so profusely illustrated to the successive
sentences of the chapter or selection, until practice and training in
these methods will make their further application unnecessary.</p>

<p>In pursuance of my plan to keep the mind in an <strong class="smcap">Assimilating</strong> condition
when trying to learn and to further aid in making the intellect stay and
work with the senses, I proceed to furnish a Training Method for
committing prose and poetry to memory.</p>

<p><em>Endless repetition or repeating a sentence to be memorised over and
over again</em> is the usual process. After one perusal, however, the mind
in such a case has sated its curiosity in regard to the meaning of the
sentence and each subsequent repetition for the purpose of fixing it in
the memory merely makes an impression upon the eye or ear or both, and
the intellect, being unoccupied, naturally wanders away. Hence, learning
by <em>rote</em> promotes <em>mind-wandering</em>: for the Attention always wanders
unless wooed to its work by all-engrossing interest in the subject which
in case of a weak power of Attention is rarely sufficient, or by <strong>the
stimulating character of the process of acquirement</strong><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;48">&zwnj;</span><a name="p48" id="p48"></a> which is made use
of. In the Method about to be given, the intellect is agreeably
occupied, and thereby a Habit of Attention is promoted.</p>

<p>The justification for this Method is found in the Psychological maxim
that the intellect can assimilate a simple idea more easily than a
complex idea, and a few ideas at a time than many ideas.</p>

<p>The process of this New Method of Decomposition and Recomposition is as
follows:&mdash;Find the <em>shortest sentence or phrase that makes sense</em> in the
sentence to be memorised. Add to this short sentence or phrase,
<em>modifiers</em> found in the original sentence, always italicising each new
addition&mdash;one at a time&mdash;until the original sentence is finally
restored. Suppose we wish to memorise Bacon&#8217;s definition of education:
&ldquo;<em>Education is the cultivation of a just and legitimate familiarity
betwixt the mind and things.</em>&rdquo; Begin with the briefest sentence and then
go on: 1. Education is cultivation. 2. Education is <em>the</em> cultivation
<em>of a familiarity</em>. 3. Education is the cultivation of a familiarity
<em>betwixt the mind and things</em>. 4. Education is the cultivation of a
<em>just</em> familiarity betwixt the mind and things. 5. Education is the
cultivation of a just <em>and legitimate</em> familiarity betwixt the mind and
things. In this process, the sentence is first taken to pieces, and then
reconstructed. Finding the lowest terms, &ldquo;Education is cultivation,&rdquo; we
proceed step by step to add modifiers until the original sentence is
fully restored.</p>

<p>Each time we make an addition, we recite <em>so much</em> of the original
sentence as has hitherto been used, in connection with the <em>new
modifiers</em> laying <em>special emphasis</em> on the new matter as represented by
the italic words. The intellect is thus kept compulsorily and
delightfully occupied from the start to the finish. It seeks the
shortest phrase or sentence and adds successively all the modifiers,
making no omissions. This analyzing and synthesizing process&mdash;<em>this
taking to pieces and then gradually building up</em> the original sentence,
makes a deep and lasting First Impression.</p>

<p>Every time this method is used the Attention ought to be strengthened
and mind-wandering diminished and the natural Memory strengthened in
both its Stages.</p>

<p>This process admits usually of several applications in<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;49">&zwnj;</span><a name="p49" id="p49"></a> the case of a
long sentence. In the foregoing example, it might have proceeded thus:
1. Education is a familiarity. 2. Education is the familiarity <em>betwixt
the mind and things</em>. 3. Education is the <em>cultivation</em> of a familiarity
betwixt the mind and things. 4. Education is the cultivation of <em>just</em>
familiarity betwixt the mind and things. 5. Education is the cultivation
of a just <em>and legitimate</em> familiarity betwixt the mind and things. Or
we might have taken this course: 1. Education is a familiarity. 2.
Education is a familiarity <em>betwixt the mind and things</em>. 3. Education
is a <em>just</em> familiarity betwixt the mind and things. 4. Education is a
just <em>and legitimate</em> familiarity betwixt the mind and things. 5.
Education is <em>the cultivation</em> of a just and legitimate familiarity
betwixt the mind and things.</p>

<h4>Moderation Advised.</h4>

<p>The practice of the above method is so attractive to a beginner when it
is applied to single sentences, that he is apt<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;51">&zwnj;</span><a name="p51" id="p51"></a> to work at it too long at
a time. Let him not at the outset analyse and reconstruct more than from
3 to 4 sentences at one sitting or lesson, but let him do what he
attempts in the most thorough manner, and after a time he will not find
it necessary to apply this method in future memorisations.</p>


<h4>Examples for Practice.</h4>

<ol>
<li>A bachelor is a wild goose that tame geese envy.</li>

<li>Law is a trap baited with promise of benefit or revenge.</li>

<li>Conversation is the idle man&#8217;s business and the business man&#8217;s
recreation.</li>

<li>Attention is adjusting the observer to the object in order to seize
it in its unity and diversity.</li>

<li>Assimilative Memory is the Habit of so receiving and absorbing
impressions and ideas that they or their representatives shall be ready
for revival or recall whenever wanted.</li>
</ol>

<h3>INTERROGATIVE ANALYSIS USED FOR SHORT SENTENCES.</h3>

<p>Interrogative Analysis or intellectual Inquisition is another and most
effective mode of inciting the intellect to pass from a passive into an
active <strong>assimilating</strong> condition when trying to learn by heart as well as
to help create the habit of the intellect staying with the senses. The
process consists of two parts: (1) <em>To not only ask a question on every
important word in the sentence to be memorised</em>, but, (2) <em>to repeat the
entire sentence in reply to each question, while specially emphasising</em>
that word of the sentence which constitutes the <em>answer</em> to the
question. Take the passage from Byron:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="poem" style="width:18em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">&ldquo;Man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou pendulum &#8217;twixt a smile and tear.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>1. <em>Who</em> is a pendulum &#8217;twixt a smile and tear? &ldquo;<em>Man!</em> thou pendulum
&#8217;twixt a smile and tear.&rdquo; 2. What function does man perform &#8217;twixt a
smile and tear? &ldquo;Man! thou<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;52">&zwnj;</span><a name="p52" id="p52"></a> <em>pendulum</em> &#8217;twixt a smile and tear.&rdquo; 3.
&#8217;Twixt a tear and what else is man said to be a pendulum? &ldquo;Man! thou
pendulum &#8217;twixt a <em>smile</em> and tear.&rdquo; 4. &#8217;Twixt a smile and what else is
man said to be a pendulum? &ldquo;Man! thou pendulum &#8217;twixt a smile <em>and
tear</em>.&rdquo; 5. By what word is the relation between &ldquo;pendulum&rdquo; and &ldquo;a smile
and tear&rdquo; described? &ldquo;Man! thou pendulum <em>&#8217;twixt</em> a smile and tear.&rdquo; 6.
Is the pendulum which man is said to be &#8217;twixt a smile and tear
addressed in the first, second, or third person? &ldquo;Man! <em>thou</em> pendulum
&#8217;twixt a smile and tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pupils will see that the above method is fundamentally unlike the
ordinary question and answer method. In the latter procedure, a question
is asked and the answer is given by &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or by the use of one
or more words of the sentence. To illustrate: What is &ldquo;man&rdquo; called in
this passage? <abbr title="Answer">Ans.</abbr> A pendulum. What swings betwixt a smile and tear?
<abbr title="Answer">Ans.</abbr> A pendulum, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Define Interrogative Analysis.</li>
<li>What does it incite the intellect to do?</li>
<li>What does the process consist of? What are they?</li>
</ol>

<p>But in my Method the aim is <em>to repeat as much of the sentence as is
possible informing the question and the whole of it in each reply</em>; and
in <em>question and reply</em> the <em>word</em> that <em>constitutes the point of both</em>
is to be especially <em>emphasized</em>, and in this way <em>the mind is exercised
on each word of the sentence twice</em> (once in question and once in
answer), and <em>each word of the sentence is emphasized in reference to
the whole of the sentence</em>. And in all these separate steps it is
impossible for the mind to remain in a passive state, but must be
<em>active</em> and <em>absorbing</em> throughout, and thereby a most vivid <strong>first
impression</strong> is secured, and the remembrance of it assured.</p>

<p>Besides the habit of exhaustively considering and weighing a sentence
which is created by this method, it not only secures the faithful
recollection of the passages to which it is applied, but it gives
another great advantage. What usually makes a person dull in
conversation? Setting aside timidity, we find that well-informed persons
are sometimes<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;53">&zwnj;</span><a name="p53" id="p53"></a> good listeners, but no talkers. Why is this? In
conversation their minds are apt to remain in a <em>recipient passive</em>
state. Hence no trains of thought arise in their own minds. And having
nothing in their minds which seeks utterance, they remain quiet. Now the
practice of Interrogative Analysis compels such persons to
interrogate&mdash;to propose questions&mdash;to think. And when such mental
activity becomes strong, it will break out in conversations by
interrogatories and critical and often original interesting remarks.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Is this method like the ordinary question and answer method?</li>
<li>How are answers given in the latter procedure?</li>
<li>What is the aim in my method?</li>
<li>How much of the sentence is repeated in each reply
given to the question?</li>
<li>What word is to be especially emphasised?</li>
<li>How often is the mind exercised on each word of the sentence?</li>
<li>In all of these separate steps, is it possible for the mind to
remain in a passive state? Must it not be active and absorbing throughout?</li>
</ol>

<p>Teachers often complain that they can never induce some of their pupils
to ask questions on their tasks. The reason is that their pupils remain
in a passive state of mind. Had they been thoroughly drilled in
Interrogative Analysis as I teach it, they would quickly have questions
to ask on all subjects.</p>

<p>I show them <em>how</em> to interrogate. They cannot help practising this
method. They commence with the first word of a sentence and go on to the
last. And from the numerous examples I give, they see exactly how this
is to be done in all other cases. But if I had merely told them to ask
questions on the sentence to be learned, they would have had no guide or
rule of procedure to follow. As I fully illustrate my Method the pupil
at once knows how to proceed, and he gains confidence in his ability to
use the method every time he tries it, and at length the Habit of active
thinking has been formed, and he is almost sure to be an interrogator
and thinker on all subjects.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">

<h3>POEMS LONG OR SHORT EASILY LEARNED BY HEART.
<br />
<span class="smcap">Poe&#8217;s &ldquo;Bells.&rdquo;</span></h3>

<p>1. Before attempting to memorize any selections of Prose or Poetry,
never fail <em>first to read it carefully</em> to ascertain what it is all
about, to learn its aim and <em>mode of development</em> and its
<em>peculiarities</em>, and not least of all, to look up and note down in
writing the <em>meaning of unfamiliar</em> words.</p>

<p>2. In this poem the average reader might have to consult the dictionary
for the precise meaning of &ldquo;Crystalline&rdquo; [clear, unalloyed], &ldquo;Runic&rdquo;
[old-fashioned, mystical], &ldquo;Tintinnabulation&rdquo; [bell-ringing], &ldquo;Monody&rdquo;
[a monotonous sound], &ldquo;Ghouls&rdquo; [imaginary evil beings supposed to prey
upon human bodies], and &ldquo;P&aelig;an&rdquo; [a song of triumph]. The pupil should
understand that except in the rare cases where mere sound helps us, we
learn wholly through the <em>meaning</em> of the words and their <em>relations</em>
between the meanings, and therefore if he fails to know the import of
any word or words in a selection, he cannot receive the full benefit of
the methods taught in this System.</p>

<p>3. The reader finds that there are four stanzas in this poem, each
dealing with a different kind of bell, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i>: Silver, Golden, Brazen
and Iron bells.</p>

<p>4. It is always best to fix in memory the order of paragraphs or of
stanzas the moment the opportunity occurs for that purpose, and here,
before attempting to memorise the stanzas themselves, let the order of
them be fixed.</p>

<p>5. The order of the bells is first &ldquo;silver,&rdquo; second &ldquo;golden,&rdquo; third
&ldquo;brazen,&rdquo; and fourth &ldquo;iron.&rdquo; How establish this order in mind? Silver
and gold are the precious metals used for coins. They occur here in the
order of<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;57">&zwnj;</span><a name="p57" id="p57"></a> their value, &ldquo;silver&rdquo; being first and the cheaper, and &ldquo;gold&rdquo;
the second and the most valuable of all. Next we have &ldquo;brazen,&rdquo; which
resembles &ldquo;gold&rdquo; in colour, and fourth and last we have &ldquo;iron,&rdquo; the
cheapest of the four&mdash;silver, gold, brass and iron. If this analysis of
the order of the subject-matter of the stanzas is retained, the student
is ready to take account of other things which his first perusal of the
poem has taught him.</p>

<p>6. Before doing so, however, let us notice a method of the old
Mnemonics, which is still taught and which should never be resorted to.
It is their story-telling method. A story or narrative is invented for
the purpose of helping the student, as it is claimed, to memorise it. In
this poem we find there are four stanzas, each occupied with a different
kind of bell. To help remember that the order of the bells is silver,
gold, brass and iron, the old Mnemonics advises us to invent a
story&mdash;the following will answer: A couple of lovers once took a
sleigh-ride, the horses carrying <em>silver</em> bells. After a time they
marry, when wedding or <em>golden</em> bells are used. Later on their house is
on fire, when alarm or <em>brazen</em> bells are brought into requisition, and
last of all, one of the couple dies, when the <em>iron</em> bells were tolled.</p>

<p>Whilst such a method is a novelty to the student, he might tolerate it
as such, but as a memory-aid it is always unreliable, since it is
something <em>in addition</em> to the matter to be remembered and forming no
part of it, the invented story, if remembered at all, is apt to be
recalled as an integral part of the selection itself.</p>

<p>7. In this first perusal the reader has noticed that there is a <em>certain
uniformity of construction</em> in the first line of each stanza, as in the
first stanza we have: &ldquo;Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells;&rdquo;
in the second, &ldquo;Hear the mellow wedding bells&mdash;golden bells;&rdquo; in the
third, &ldquo;Hear the loud alarum bells&mdash;brazen bells;&rdquo; and in the fourth and
last, &ldquo;Hear the tolling of the bells&mdash;iron bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>8. The reader has also observed that the second line in each stanza
contains a reflection in the form of an exclamation on the function or
result of the uses of the bells spoken of, as in the second line of the
first stanza we see: &ldquo;What a world of merriment their melody
foretells;&rdquo; in the second stanza the second line gives us, &ldquo;What a world<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;58">&zwnj;</span><a name="p58" id="p58"></a>
of happiness their harmony foretells;&rdquo; the second line of the third
stanza reads as follows: &ldquo;What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency
tells;&rdquo; and in the fourth stanza the second line runs thus: &ldquo;What a
world of solemn thought their monody compels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>9. Other points of resemblance [<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>], or of unlikeness [<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>], were
noticed in the reader&#8217;s first perusal of this poem, and these, as well
as those already remarked upon, will greatly facilitate his learning the
exact language of each stanza.</p>

<p>10. Now comes the <em>test</em>. It is often said that habit is &ldquo;second&rdquo;
nature. The Duke of Wellington more truly said: &ldquo;Habit is <em>ten times</em>
nature.&rdquo; The reader early acquired the habit of learning prose and
poetry by the <em>rote</em> method&mdash;the method of repeating the sentences over
and over again almost endlessly till ear or eye retains the exact
language.</p>

<p>Now, if the reader has gained a <em>clear conception</em> of the
Analytic-Synthetic and Interrogative Analysis methods, he is sure to be
convinced of their undoubted superiority to the <em>rote</em> method. And if he
must needs learn Poe&#8217;s &ldquo;Bells&rdquo; before to-morrow night, he would probably
spend most of the intervening time in trying to learn it by the
discredited <em>rote</em> method, and most likely fail in the attempt, while he
is satisfied in theory that he could memorise it by one of my methods in
three hours, or in half of that time. The difficulty in his case is to
induce him to exert his willpower long enough to practise my methods in
learning not a few detached sentences, but an entire poem of 50 or 200
lines; but if he does this in one instance, he effectually breaks down
the old bad habit of endless unassimilating repetition and introduces a
good habit instead. He will then learn Poe&#8217;s &ldquo;Bells&rdquo; by my methods in
one-tenth, if not one-fiftieth, part of the time it would take him to do
it by the <em>rote</em> method.</p>

<p>11. I here produce the poem in the hope that every one who studies my
System will learn it by the Analytic-Synthetic method, and when he has
learned the first stanza he should then glance at my Analysis of it
which follows the poem and compare his work with mine. Let him then
learn the rest of the poem&mdash;and thereafter, as a genuine<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;59">&zwnj;</span><a name="p59" id="p59"></a> exercise of his
<em>reviving</em> power and as a training in attention, let him recall it as
often as once a week for as many weeks as his desire for improvement
continues, or until the recital of it becomes merely automatic.</p>

<h4>APPLICATION OF THE ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC METHOD.</h4>

<p>This method can be applied in several different ways according to the
idiosyncrasies of different students. One way is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Hear the
sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells.&rdquo; Applying this method, we have&mdash;1.
Hear the sledges; 2. Hear the sledges <em>with the bells</em>; 3. Hear the
sledges with the bells&mdash;<em>bells</em>; 4. Hear the sledges with the
bells&mdash;<em>silver</em> bells. Or, if we use the Interrogatory Analysis Method
we could proceed thus: 1. What act of the mind do we exercise in regard
to the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells? &ldquo;<em>Hear</em> the sledges with
the bells&mdash;silver bells.&rdquo;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;61">&zwnj;</span><a name="p61" id="p61"></a> 2. What kind of a vehicle do we hear with the
bells? &ldquo;Hear <em>the sledges</em> with the bells&mdash;silver bells.&rdquo; 3. What is it
we hear in connection with the sledges? &ldquo;Hear the sledges with <em>the
bells</em>&mdash;silver <em>bells</em>.&rdquo; 4. What kind of bells do we hear? &ldquo;Hear the
sledges with the bells&mdash;<em>silver</em> bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We advance to the second line, which is a reflection on the facts stated
in the first line. The two lines are thus connected through the
operation of cause, or occasion. [<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>] &ldquo;What a world of merriment their
melody foretells.&rdquo; We will henceforth only use the Analytic-Synthetic
Method. 1. Melody foretells. 2. <em>Their</em> melody foretells. 3. <em>What
merriment</em> their melody foretells. 4. What <em>a world</em> of merriment their
melody foretells. Having seen that the second line grows out of the
first, and having memorised both we can recall them together thus:</p>


<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;">
<li>Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells&mdash;</li>
<li>What a world of merriment their melody <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original read &lsquo;fortells&rsquo;.">foretells</ins>!</li>
</ol>

<p>The third line runs thus: &ldquo;How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle in the icy
air of night.&rdquo; Melody means &ldquo;a succession of agreeable musical sounds.&rdquo;
It is a general term&mdash;<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original lacked an opening quote mark.">&ldquo;</ins>tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,&rdquo; means a species of
musical sounds, the sounds of the bells. Thus we see that these two
lines bear towards each other the relation of genus and species. This
relation carefully noticed will tend to hold the lines together. Let us
now apply our Method: 1. They tinkle. 2. They tinkle <em>in the night</em>. 3.
<em>How</em> they tinkle in the night. 4. How they tinkle, <em>tinkle</em> in the
night. 5. How they tinkle, tinkle, <em>tinkle</em> in the night. 6. How they
tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, in the <em>air of</em> night. 7. How they tinkle,
tinkle, tinkle in the <em>icy</em> air of night. Now let us recall all the
lines together, thus:</p>

<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;">
<li>Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells&mdash;</li>
<li>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!</li>
<li>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle in the icy air of night!</li>
</ol>

<p>The fourth line being very short had better be memorised in connection
with the fifth line, and in the expression of the Analysis, we can print
the first word of the fifth line with a capital letter. The two lines
are:</p>

<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;" start="4">
<li>While the stars that oversprinkle</li>
<li>All the heavens, seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;62">&zwnj;</span><a name="p62" id="p62"></a>Before proceeding we may notice &ldquo;night&rdquo; of the third line is directly
connected with &ldquo;stars&rdquo; of the fourth line by Concurrence. This observed
relation will tend to cement the lines together. Using our Method we
say: 1. Stars oversprinkle. 2. <em>While the</em> stars oversprinkle. 3. While
the stars oversprinkle <em>the heavens</em>. 4. While the stars oversprinkle
<em>All the heavens</em>. 5. While the stars <em>that</em> oversprinkle All the
heavens. 6. While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens <em>seem to
twinkle</em>. 7. While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens seem to
twinkle <em>with delight</em>. 8. While the stars that oversprinkle All the
heavens seem to twinkle with a <em>crystalline</em> delight. So far we have
learned the following lines:</p>

<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;">
<li>Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells&mdash;</li>
<li>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!</li>
<li>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle in the icy air of night!</li>
<li>While the stars that oversprinkle</li>
<li>All the heavens, seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>sixth</em> line is in these words: &ldquo;Keeping time, time, time, in a sort
of Runic rhyme.&rdquo; We observe that as &ldquo;time&rdquo; is here repeated three times,
so &ldquo;tinkle&rdquo; was repeated three times in the third line. We must have
observed, too, that it is &ldquo;stars&rdquo; of the fourth line that are said to
&ldquo;twinkle&rdquo; in the fifth line. The two lines are as closely connected as
grammatical construction and the expression of thought could make them.
And the sixth line is an obvious continuation of the description.
Analytically we say: 1. Keeping time in a rhyme. 2. Keeping time,
<em>time</em>, in a rhyme. 3. Keeping time, time, <em>time</em> in a rhyme. 4. Keeping
time, time, time in a <em>sort</em> of rhyme. 5. Keeping time, time, time in a
sort of <em>Runic</em> rhyme.</p>

<p>Let us now recall the six lines together.</p>

<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;">
<li>Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells&mdash;</li>
<li>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!</li>
<li>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle in the icy air of night!</li>
<li>While the stars that oversprinkle</li>
<li>All the heavens, seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight;</li>
<li>Keeping time, time, time, in a sort of Runic rhyme.</li>
</ol>

<p>The seventh line is the continuation of the sixth. Keeping time to what?
&ldquo;To the tintinnabulation that so musically<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;63">&zwnj;</span><a name="p63" id="p63"></a> wells.&rdquo; 1. The
tintinnabulation wells. 2. The tintinnabulation <em>that</em> wells. 3. The
tintinnabulation that <em>musically</em> wells. 4. The tintinnabulation that
<em>so</em> musically wells. 5. <em>To</em> the tintinnabulation that so musically
wells. Wells from what? From the bells, bells&mdash;occurring altogether six
times more. This makes the eighth line. But some pupils say at once, &ldquo;I
can never be sure in reciting the line to recall bells only seven times,
no more or less.&rdquo; These pupils will admit that they can be sure to say
bells <em>four</em> times, as bells, bells, bells, bells. Then, of course, they
can say bells <em>three</em> times more, making seven times altogether. Here,
then, we have the seventh and eighth lines, as follows:</p>


<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;" start="7">
<li>To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells</li>
<li>From the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells&mdash;</li>
</ol>

<p>The ninth line is&mdash;&ldquo;From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the eighth line we have &ldquo;bells&rdquo; seven times repeated in all&mdash;bells
being taken in their utmost generality, viz., <em>musical</em> action. But in
the ninth or last line we have the very specific action of the bells, to
wit: &ldquo;From the <em>jingling</em> and the <em>tinkling</em> of the bells.&rdquo; We can make
a short analysis, which is always better than unthinking repetition, as:
1. From the bells. 2. From the <em>jingling</em> of the bells. 3. From the
jingling <em>and the tinkling</em> of the bells. The seventh, eighth, and ninth
lines are as follows:</p>


<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;" start="7">
<li>To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells</li>
<li>From the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells&mdash;</li>
<li>From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having already learned the first six lines, we have but to preface these
last three by the previous six, and we have the first stanza as
follows:&mdash;</p>


<ol class="poem" style="width: 33em;">
<li>Hear the sledges with the bells&mdash;silver bells&mdash;</li>
<li>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!</li>
<li>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle in the icy air of night!</li>
<li>While the stars that oversprinkle</li>
<li>All the heavens, seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight;</li>
<li>Keeping time, time, time, in a sort of Runic rhyme,</li>
<li>To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells</li>
<li>From the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells&mdash;</li>
<li>From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;64">&zwnj;</span><a name="p64" id="p64"></a>In a similar manner, the pupil can memorise the three remaining stanzas.</p>

<p>Having heretofore learned the order of the four different kinds of
bells, and having dealt with the first or &ldquo;silver&rdquo; bells, we know that
the next or second stanza is concerned with the &ldquo;golden&rdquo; bells.
Similarly, when we finish the second stanza, we know that the third
stanza deals with the &ldquo;brazen&rdquo; bells, and the last with the &ldquo;iron&rdquo;
bells.</p>

<p>No further hints need be offered except perhaps in regard to the last
ten lines of the last stanza.</p>

<p>Notice the coincidences, the resemblances, or Inclusions, the
Exclusions, and the Concurrences. &ldquo;Keeping time, time, time, in a sort
of Runic rhyme,&rdquo; occurs three times&mdash;but on the third appearance of that
phrase, there is a change which must be observed; for it bears this
form: &ldquo;Keeping time, time, time, <em>as he knells, knells, knells, in a
happy</em> Runic rhyme.&rdquo; But the main difficulty with most students seems to
be to remember <em>the number of times</em> the word &ldquo;bells&rdquo; is repeated in the
different lines. We must keep to the text and not resort to any foreign
matter to help the feeble memory. The words <em>p&aelig;an</em>, <em>throbbing</em>,
<em>sobbing</em>, <em>rolling</em> and <em>tolling</em> occur in the lines where the &ldquo;bells&rdquo;
are mentioned (except in that next to the last line, where &ldquo;bells&rdquo;
occurs three times, and there is no other word in that line), and in the
last line &ldquo;bells&rdquo; is found once, and the words &ldquo;moaning&rdquo; and &ldquo;groaning&rdquo;
appear. Memorise these seven words by Analysis, to wit: p&aelig;an, throbbing,
sobbing, rolling, tolling, moaning and groaning. Thus <em>p&aelig;an</em>&mdash;a song of
triumph&mdash;might cause heart <em>throbbing</em>, an inward act accompanied in the
present instance by <em>sobbing</em>, and this outward manifestation of grief
would be intensified by the <em>rolling</em> of the bells and their <em>tolling</em>.
<em>Moaning</em> and <em>groaning</em> are figurative expressions for the moaning and
groaning of the mourners.</p>

<p>Now the figures 2, 4, 1, 4, 8, 1 (easily learned by analysis as 2, 4, 1
and 4, 8, 1, or 2, 4 with 1 following, and 4, 8, with 1 following, or 2,
4 with 1 following, and [double 2, 4] 4, 8 and 1 following) give the
<em>number of times</em> the word &ldquo;bells&rdquo; occurs in connection with the words
just learned. Opposite the line where <em>tolling</em> occurs we have marked 8,
since<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;65">&zwnj;</span><a name="p65" id="p65"></a> &ldquo;bells&rdquo; occurs in that line five times and three times in the next
line, where no other word is found.</p>

<p>Carrying these suggestions to the text, they help fix the exact number
of times the word &ldquo;bells&rdquo; occurs in each line. There are other
legitimate ways to assist a poor memory to master these lines, but
whatever is done let no one ever think of resorting to the unthoughtive,
brainless process of endless repetition.</p>

<p>Poe&#8217;s &ldquo;Bells,&rdquo; being a difficult selection to learn, furnishes, as all
difficult selections do, numerous opportunities for applying Analysis to
fix the lines in memory. Hence it should be <em>mastered</em> and often recited
by all who would learn to memorise poetry or prose, in, at the very
least, <em>one-fifth</em> of the time required by the old mind-wandering
process of <em>rote</em> learning. <a class="toclink" rel="contents" title="Contents." href="#CONTENTS">&larr;ToC</a></p>

<br />
<small>ANOTHER METHOD FOR REMEMBERING DATES AND FIGURES.</small></h2>


<p>This lesson in figures is given for the benefit of those who have not
yet mastered <strong class="smcap">Numeric Thinking</strong>. The pupil will appreciate its practical
value the moment he masters the key to it.</p>

<p>This is given in the next few pages, and it will be found to be easy of
comprehension and interesting to a surprising degree.</p>

<p>The whole thing is in a nutshell. Numbers, as such, are abstractions and
hard to be remembered. To make them hard to forget, we translate them
into words or phrases. These are easily remembered and they always
instantly <em>give back</em> the figures they stand for.</p>

<p>We represent the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0, by certain
<em>consonants</em>; and then, as the vowels [a, e, i, o, u, and y, together
with w] have <em>no numerical</em> value assigned to them, we turn dates or any
numbers into translating <em>words</em>, which will always tell us precisely
the figures the words stand for.</p>

<p>As this simple process enables us to remember any dates or numbers with
<em>absolute certainty</em>, the pupil will be pleased to know that he can
learn <em>how it is done</em> by only <em>one thoughtful</em> perusal.</p>

<p>The questions at the bottom of each page constitute an invaluable aid to
test the accuracy of his knowledge and the correctness of his
inferences.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Is it possible to exaggerate the importance of this lesson?</li>
<li>When will the pupil appreciate its practical value?</li>
<li>Where is this key given?</li>
<li>Are numbers hard to remember?</li>
<li>How do we make them hard to forget?</li>
<li>By what are the figures represented?</li>
<li>What letters have no numerical value assigned to them?</li>
<li>What do the questions at the bottom of each page constitute?</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;67">&zwnj;</span><a name="p67" id="p67"></a>The nought and the nine digits are <em>represented</em> by the following
<em>consonants</em> when they are <em>sounded</em> or <em>pronounced</em>; viz., 0 (nought)
by s, z, or c<sup>soft</sup> as in cease, 1 by t, th, or d, 2 by n, 3 by m, 4 by
r, 5 by l, 6 by sh, j, ch, or g<sup>soft</sup> as in the first g of George, 7
g<sup>hard</sup> as in Gorge, k, c<sup>hard</sup> as in <i>c</i>ane, q, or ng, 8 by f or v,
and 9 by b or p.</p>

<p>Ample practice in translating the sounded consonants of words into
figures, or of figures into the sounded consonants of words will now be
given. If the reader can <em>remember</em> the foregoing consonant equivalents
of figures in connection with the tabulated Figure Alphabet on the <a href="#p74">74th
page</a> of this lesson, he can at once pass on through the book. If not, he
must carefully study the intervening pages with painstaking&mdash;for when
once learned, no further difficulty can arise.</p>

<p>The tabulated Figure Alphabet on the 74th page of this lesson expresses
the consonant values of the nought and nine digits in perpendicular
columns, as under nought (0) are placed <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, and <em>c</em><sup>soft</sup>; under
nine are placed <em>b</em> and <em>p</em>; under six are placed <em>sh</em>, <em>j</em>, <em>ch</em>, and
<em>g</em><sup>soft</sup>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Only those who possess first-rate natural memories can
learn the equivalents of the sounded consonants in figures from this
table. But when learned in this way, the pupil requires much practice in
translating words into figures and figures into words. Even this
exceptional pupil had better carefully study the ensuing examples.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is to learn <em>which</em> consonants are used to
stand for and represent the nought (0) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Let the student remember that we use vowels to make words with, but we
do not give the vowels [a, e, i, o, u], or w, or y, <em>any number value
whatever</em>.</p>

<p><strong class="smcap">We represent the nought or cypher [0] by the consonants s, z, or
c<sup>soft</sup> [as in <em>cease</em>].</strong></p>

<p>The figure value of &ldquo;sew,&rdquo; therefore equals or is represented by a
cipher [0]. S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and the vowel &ldquo;e&rdquo; and the consonant &ldquo;w&rdquo; have <em>no figure
value</em>. Cannot the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;68">&zwnj;</span><a name="p68" id="p68"></a> student understand at once that <i>S</i>ay&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, <i>S</i>ee&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,
Ea<i>s</i>e&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, I<i>s</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and <i>Z</i>oe&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and <i>S</i>ei<i>z</i>e&nbsp;=&nbsp;00, <i>S</i>i<i>z</i>e&nbsp;=&nbsp;00,
<i>S</i>au<i>c</i>e&nbsp;=&nbsp;00?</p>

<p>The following is another way of fixing in mind this first rule.</p>

<p>If the capital letter <strong class="sf">S</strong> were cut into two parts, and the bottom half
attached to the top half, it would make a nought (<strong>0</strong>). <i>So it is easy to
remember that S represents <strong>0</strong>.</i> C<sup>soft</sup> as in <em>cease</em> has the same sound
as S, and should therefore stand for the same figure, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i>, 0; and Z
is a cognate of S&mdash;that is, it is <em>made by the same organs of speech in
the same position</em> as when making S, only it is an undertone, and S is a
whispered letter. Besides Z should represent <strong>0</strong> because it begins the
word Zero&mdash;C<sup>soft</sup> should also stand for <strong>0</strong> for the additional reason
that C<sup>soft</sup> begins the word cipher. <em>In translating a word into
figures we always turn S, Z, or C<sup>soft</sup> into nought</em> (0); <em>in turning
figures into words we always translate a nought</em> (0) <em>into S, Z, or
C<sup>soft</sup>.</em></p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>What is the first thing to be done?</li>
<li>What must the student remember in connection with vowels?</li>
<li>By what do we represent the cipher?</li>
<li>What other way is given for fixing the first rule in the mind?</li>

<p><strong class="smcap">1 is represented by the consonant &ldquo;t,&rdquo; &ldquo;th,&rdquo; or &ldquo;d.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><i>T</i>oy&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. As &ldquo;t&rdquo; stands for 1, and o and y are vowels, and have no

<p>&ldquo;t&rdquo; stands for 1, because it is made with <em>one</em> downward stroke. &ldquo;h&rdquo; has
no figure value except when it is united with &ldquo;s&rdquo; or &ldquo;c&rdquo; in sh or ch,
and therefore &ldquo;th&rdquo; <em>must</em> represent 1, and d, being the cognate of &ldquo;t,&rdquo;
it is represented by 1. Hence we translate &ldquo;t,&rdquo; &ldquo;th,&rdquo; and &ldquo;d&rdquo; by the
figure 1, and when we want to represent 1, by letters, we translate it

<p>This explanation is a help to remember the <em>letter-values of the
figures</em>. Another way to fix these values in mind for permanent use is
to turn <em>words into figures</em>, as in going through an ordinary
spelling-book. This practice quickly enables you to <em>turn figures into
words</em>, and to translate them back into figures. Facility will be
attained long before the lessons are completed. But this lesson,
<em>thoroughly</em> studied, will secure the needful proficiency.</p>

<ol class="dashes">
<li>&mdash;Two consonants of the <em>same kind</em> with no vowel between,
provided they have the <em>same</em> sound, are treated as one
consonant, as &ldquo;ll&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, &ldquo;nn&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, &ldquo;rr&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, &ldquo;dd&rdquo;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The

(not &ldquo;ban&rdquo;) with a &ldquo;k&rdquo; after it; ng are not always taken
together as one sound and translated into 7, but when they

S and z sometimes =&nbsp;zh, which is the cognate equivalent of

<h4>HOW TO DEAL WITH DECIMAL FRACTIONS.</h4>

<p>The pupil may skip the next paragraph if not wishing to deal with
decimals.</p>

<p>[As a rule, it is better not to use words <em>beginning</em> with S, except to
translate <em>decimals</em> and <em>fractions</em>, and Date-words where a <em>doubt</em>
might otherwise arise (unless in a phrase like &ldquo;To see Jiji,&rdquo; &ldquo;delay a
spy,&rdquo; <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>); and in case of the <em>decimals</em>, S, as the <em>initial</em> letter,
means (not 0, but) the decimal point. (1) If there is an integer
followed by a decimal, two separate words are used; the decimal-word
begins with S, thus: 945.51&nbsp;= barley sold; 71.3412&nbsp;= &ldquo;good Samaritan.&rdquo;
(2) If it is a decimal by itself, the S indicates the decimal point
only; .01&nbsp;=&nbsp;society; .02&nbsp;=&nbsp;Susan; .94&nbsp;=&nbsp;sparrow. (3) If it is a vulgar
fraction, the words translating numerator and denominator begin with<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;74">&zwnj;</span><a name="p74" id="p74"></a> S,
and the S&#8217;s are not counted, the numerator-word coming first, and the
denominator-word last; thus 5/12&nbsp;= sell Satan.]</p>


<p>As to Date-words, just <em>before</em> the Christian Era you may use an initial
S [or the vowel A, or any other vowel], as, Stir would mean 14&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span>
[Before Christ]; and, of course, Tower would mean 14&nbsp;<span class="allsc">A.D.</span> [for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anno
Domini</i>&mdash;in the year of our Lord]; Soar&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span>, and Rue&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;<span class="allsc">A.D.</span> In a

<h3 class="smcap">How to Find words with Which to Translate Dates and Numbers.</h3>

<p>It is a simple and easy process; knowing exactly what consonants are
used to represent each of the numbers, you simply write at the side of
the numbers to be turned into words the consonants which stand for them;
and using any vowels you please, you find out by experimenting what
words can translate the figures. Suppose you wish to find out what words
will translate the date of the settlement of Jamestown, <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, 1607. You
place the figures under each other as below, and then you place at the
right hand of each figure the consonants which translate it.</p>

<ul>
<li>1&nbsp;= t, th, d.</li>
<li>6&nbsp;= sh, j, ch, g soft (as in gem),</li>
<li>0&nbsp;= s, z, c soft (as in cease).</li>
<li>7&nbsp;= g hard, k, c hard, q, and ng.</li>
</ul>

<p>By experimenting you soon find the following phrases will represent
1607; as, &ldquo;A <i>D</i>u<i>tch</i> <i>S</i>o<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>D</i>a<i>sh</i> a <i>S</i>a<i>ck</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>T</i>o wa<i>sh</i> a
<i>S</i>o<i>ck</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>Ch</i>oo<i>s</i>i<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>Ch</i>a<i>s</i>i<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>T</i>ou<i>ch</i>e<i>s</i>
a <i>K</i>ey,&rdquo; <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Try the date of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States,
1787. Writing down the numbers as before, you place t, th, d, opposite
1; g hard, k, c hard, q, ng, opposite 7; f and v, opposite 8; g hard, k,
c hard, q, and ng, opposite 7; and then you soon find translating words,
as follows: &ldquo;<i>T</i>o <i>g</i>i<i>v</i>e a <i>K</i>ey,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>g</i>i<i>v</i>i<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e
<i>q</i>ua<i>f</i>fi<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>C</i>ou<i>gh</i>i<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>In all cases you must carefully comply with the rules<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;76">&zwnj;</span><a name="p76" id="p76"></a> and explanations
heretofore given. A little practice will enable you to dispense with
writing down the figures and the consonants which represent them; but at
first pains must be taken in the above way to secure accuracy.</p>

<li>Deal with an original date in the way indicated here.</li>
<li>In dealing with the date of the foundation of Yale College, would
the phrase &ldquo;taxes due&rdquo; express 1701?</li>
<li>If not, why?</li>
<li>Can you translate into a word or phrase the date of your own birth?</li>
<li>Translate into words or phrases the birth and death
dates of some of the historic characters which you admire most.</li>
<li>Keep a record of these words or phrases for future examination.</li>
</ol>

<p>Try 1636, the date of the founding of Harvard College: You obtain
&ldquo;<i>D</i>a<i>sh</i> a <i>m</i>i<i>dg</i>e,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>ch</i>u<i>m</i> a<i>g</i>e,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>T</i>ea<i>ch</i> <i>m</i>u<i>ch</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>T</i>o <i>sh</i>ow <i>m</i>y <i>j</i>oy,&rdquo; <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The founding of Yale College in 1701 gives: &ldquo;<i>T</i>oo<i>k</i> a <i>s</i>ea<i>t</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>c</i>o<i>st</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>q</i>ue<i>st</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>c</i>a<i>st</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;A <i>t</i>a<i>x</i>

<p>Sometimes the first consonants only of words are used. Comenius,
Educational Reformer (things before words, pictured illustrations, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>)
and Moravian Bishop, was born 1592: or (1) <i>Th</i>ings (5) We<i>l</i>l (9)
<i>P</i>ictured (2) <i>N</i>ow. He died 1671; or A (1) <i>T</i>eaching (6) <i>Ch</i>urchman

<h4>SYNTHETIC TRANSLATION OF FIGURES.</h4>

<p><em>When the word or phrase used to translate figures sustains no relation
of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, to the event itself, that word or phrase is
synthetic and is dealt with hereafter.</em></p>

<p>Nearly all the translating words given in this section so far are
synthetic. &ldquo;The coughing,&rdquo; sustains no relation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, to
the adoption of the Constitution of the U.&nbsp;S., and is therefore
relegated to the next chapter for the method of cementing it to that
event if we were obliged to use that phrase.</p>

<p>Synthesis will be sometimes hereafter resorted to to connect in our
minds an event to its date. When this will be necessary, the sequel will
show.</p>


<h4>ANALYTIC DATE AND NUMBER WORDS.</h4>

<p><em>When the word or phrase which translates the date or number sustains
the relation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, to the event or fact itself, that
word or phrase is analytic, and is memorised by merely assimilating that
relation.</em></p>

<p>Different ways of expressing figures by words, phrases, or sentences
that are self-connected to the fact or event will now be given.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;77">&zwnj;</span><a name="p77" id="p77"></a>1. <strong class="smcap">Sometimes all the sounded consonants of a word or phrase are used.</strong></p>

<p>Room-mates in college are called &ldquo;chums.&rdquo; Harvard College&mdash;the oldest

<p>The annual production of iron in America is said to be <em>six million four
hundred and twenty-seven thousand, one hundred and forty-eight</em> tons.
These figures may be analytically expressed thus: &ldquo;Hu<i>g</i>e i<i>r</i>o<i>n</i> we
<i>g</i>e<i>t</i> <i>r</i>ou<i>gh</i>&rdquo; [6,427,148&nbsp;tons].</p>

<p>A characteristic of Herbert Spencer is the accuracy of his definitions.
His birth, in 1820, may be indicated by this significant phrase: &ldquo;He
<i>D</i>e<i>f</i>i<i>n</i>e<i>s</i>&rdquo; [1820].</p>

<p>2. <strong class="smcap">Sometimes only the initial consonants of the words or phrases or
sentences are used.</strong></p>

<p>Caius Julius C&aelig;sar was born 100&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span>, and he died 44&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> His birth may
be expressed by the phrase, (1) &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e (0) <i>S</i>tripling (0) <i>C</i>&aelig;sar;&rdquo; and
his death by a phrase which declares that his death was the remote
result of his crossing the Rubicon, thus: (4) &ldquo;<i>R</i>ubicon&#8217;s (4)
<i>R</i>evenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marcus Tullius Cicero was born 106&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span>, and he died 43&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> His birth:
(1) &ldquo;<i>T</i>ullius (0) <i>C</i>icero&#8217;s (6) <i>Ch</i>ildhood.&rdquo; His death: (4) &ldquo;<i>R</i>emove

<p>The city of Melbourne was named after Lord Melbourne in 1837, or (3)
&ldquo;<i>M</i>elbourne (7) <i>Ch</i>ristened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be convenient to consider all compound names of cities or places
as if they were single words, using only the initial consonant of the
first of the names, as (2) <i>N</i>ew-York, or (2) <i>N</i>ew-Amsterdam, or (2)
U<i>n</i>ited-States, etc.</p>

<p>New York City [at first known as New Amsterdam] was settled by the Dutch
in 1626, or New York founded: (1) &ldquo;<i>D</i>utchmen (6) <i>Ch</i>ose (2)
<i>N</i>ew-Amsterdam (6) <i>J</i>oyfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virginia was settled at Jamestown in 1607. This date<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;78">&zwnj;</span><a name="p78" id="p78"></a> may be analytically
expressed thus: (1) &ldquo;<i>Th</i>en (6) <i>J</i>amestown (0) Wa<i>s</i> (7) <i>C</i>olonized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exact population of the United States, according to the census of
1880, may be expressed through the initial consonants of the following
sentence: &ldquo;A (5) <i>L</i>ate (0) <i>C</i>ensus, (1) &lsquo;Eigh<i>t</i>y&#8217;s&rsquo; (8) <i>F</i>urnishes
(9) <i>P</i>recise (2) U<i>n</i>ited-States (0) <i>S</i>overeign (9) <i>P</i>opulation,&rdquo; or
50,189,209.</p>

<p>The <em>exact</em> population of the United States declared in June, 1890,
commonly called the <em>census of &ldquo;ninety,&rdquo;</em> was stated as <em>sixty-two
millions six hundred and twenty-two thousand two hundred and fifty</em>, or
&ldquo;A (6) <i>G</i>eneral (2) E<i>n</i>umeration (6) whi<i>ch</i> (2) U<i>n</i>doubtedly (2)
I<i>n</i>dicates (2) &lsquo;<i>N</i>inety&#8217;s&rsquo; (5) <i>L</i>arge (0) <i>C</i>ensus.&rdquo; 62,622,250, or
for the last three figures we could say: (2) U<i>n</i>ited States&#8217; (5)
<i>L</i>arge (0) <i>C</i>ensus.</p>

<p>Before the close of the year 1890 an official census of the Whites and
Indians on the Indian Reservations added 243,875 to the above number,
making the total population of the United States in 1890, 62,866,125. A
(6) <i>G</i>eneral (2) E<i>n</i>umeration (8) O<i>f</i>ficially (6) S<i>h</i>ows (6) <i>J</i>ust
(1) <i>Th</i>e (2) <i>N</i>umber (5) <i>L</i>iving. Now (1895) it is computed to be
67,000,000 [to express the round numbers of millions, we could say, (6)
<i>J</i>ust (7) <i>G</i>overnment or (6) <i>Ch</i>arming (7) <i>C</i>ountry].</p>

<p>The birth of Herbert Spencer, in 1820, may be expressed thus: (1)
A<i>d</i>vent (8) o<i>f</i> (2) I<i>n</i>fant (0) <i>S</i>pencer, or (1) <i>Th</i>e (8) <i>F</i>uture
(2) &ldquo;U<i>n</i>knowable&rdquo; (0) <i>S</i>pencer, (2) I<i>n</i>fant (0) <i>S</i>pencer. Several
different ways of expressing the <em>same date</em> will be given in a few
cases.</p>

<p>It is often convenient for a teacher, and others, to recall the number
of a page of a book in which a citation is found. In Prof. William
James&#8217;s Psychology Abridged for Schools and Colleges, the chapter on
Habit begins on <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;134, or &ldquo;(1) <i>Th</i>e (3) <i>M</i>ould (4) <i>R</i>ules;&rdquo; the
chapter on Will begins on <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;415: &ldquo;A (4) <i>R</i>esolve (1) <i>D</i>enotes

<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;253, or (2) &ldquo;<i>N</i>ow (5) He<i>l</i>p (3) <i>M</i>emory;&rdquo; and that on Memory on
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;287, or &ldquo;(2) I<i>n</i>tellect (8) <i>F</i>orbids (7) <i>C</i>ramming.&rdquo; Prof.
Loisette&#8217;s New York Office is in<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;79">&zwnj;</span><a name="p79" id="p79"></a> Fifth Avenue at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr>&nbsp;237, or &ldquo;A (2)

A<i>c</i>quired.&rdquo; His London Office was formerly at 37 [a <i>m</i>emory <i>g</i>ained]
New Oxford Street. It is now at <em>200&nbsp;Regent Street, London</em> [(2) <i>N</i>ow
(0) <i>S</i>ecure (0) A<i>s</i>similation].</p>

<p>3. <strong class="smcap">Sometimes the first two consonants of a word are used.</strong></p>

<p>Sheridan&#8217;s famous ride occurred in 1864. In dates of the last and
present century it is usual to indicate the last two figures of the
date. 64, therefore, is all we need express. Formula: Sheridan&#8217;s ride in
1864&mdash;(64) <i>Ch</i>ee<i>r</i>s; or, (64) <i>Sh</i>e<i>r</i>idan. The Pennsylvania Whisky
Rebellion took place in 1794; or, (94) <i>Br</i>ewery.</p>

<p>4. <strong class="smcap">Sometimes the first and last consonants of a word are used, and
sometimes two consonants in the middle of a word.</strong></p>

<p>These devices are rarely resorted to, but if ever used, they must be
thoroughly assimilated. Battle of Waterloo was fought in 1815; 15 may be
found in the <em>t</em> and <em>l</em> of (15) Wa<i>t</i>er<i>l</i>oo. Herbert Spencer was born,
as we have already seen, in 1820. The 20 may be found in the <em>n</em> and <em>c</em>
of Spe<i>nc</i>er.</p>

<p>5. Never, on any account, use the same word to express two different
dates; as, its first two consonants for one date and its two middle, or
its first and last consonants, to express another date.</p>

<p>6. <em>Never fail to carefully analyse the relations between the fact or
event and its date or number word.</em></p>

<p><strong class="smcap">Subject to the exceptions hereafter named, all dates and numbers should
be exactly expressed in the date or number words.</strong></p>

<p>Alexander the Great was born 356&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> and died in a drunken debauch
323&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span> His birth: (3) <i>M</i>acedonia&#8217;s (5) A<i>l</i>exander a (6) <i>Ch</i>ild. His
death: A (3) <i>M</i>acedonian&#8217;s (2) I<i>n</i>ebriation (3) <i>M</i>ortal. Several
mnemonists of the old school have for the past forty years used the
phrase &ldquo;Rise, Sire,&rdquo; to express the date of the creation of the world,
which according to the accepted biblical chronology took place 4004&nbsp;<span class="allsc">B.C.</span>
But that phrase, proper enough in the mouths of the sons of Noah, when
they found their father lying on the ground in a fit of intoxication,
could have no<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;80">&zwnj;</span><a name="p80" id="p80"></a> pertinence when applied to the Creator, to the creation in
general, or to the creation of this world in particular. A
self-connected phrase would, however, express this date as follows:
&ldquo;Creation of the World: (4) Ea<i>r</i>th (0) <i>S</i>tarted (0) <i>S</i>wiftly (4)
<i>R</i>otating.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>First Exception.</em>&mdash;From <span class="allsc">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1000 to <span class="allsc">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1700 the last three figures
of the date should be expressed in the date words. <i>M</i>a<i>rs</i> expresses
340 and could be used to indicate the invention of cannon in (1) 340 by
one who knew that Mars was the name of the god of war in classic
mythology. The formula would be: &ldquo;Invention of cannon: (1) 340
<i>M</i>a<i>rs</i>.&rdquo; But this term would have no mnemonic significance to one who
knows the word Mars as meaning only one of the planets. Hence the
danger&mdash;ever to be avoided&mdash;of using classical allusions in teaching the
average student. A (3) <i>m</i>artial (4) O<i>r</i>gan (0) <i>S</i>ways, or <i>m</i>urderous
a<i>r</i>tillery <i>s</i>tarted.</p>

<p><em>Second Exception.</em>&mdash;From <span class="allsc">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1700 to the present moment, the last two
figures must be expressed in the date words. Many examples will
hereafter illustrate this exception. In very rare cases, the expression
of the last figure in the date word will suffice. We know that Ralph
Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes [author of the Autocrat of the
Breakfast Table] were born towards the beginning of this century, the
former in 1803 and the latter in 1809. The following formulas would give
the date of their birth: Ralph Waldo (180)3 E<i>m</i>erson; Oliver Wendell
Holmes (180)9 &ldquo;<i>B</i>reakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Third Exception.</em>&mdash;In cases where there is no practical utility in
comparing one very large number with another, as in the case of the
distances of the planets from the sun, mere round numbers may suffice,
yet astronomers must know such numbers with exactness. But in regard to
all mundane affairs, the pupil must throw off the character of scholar
and assume the license of children, if he attempts to express large
numbers, as of populations, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, by &ldquo;guessing,&rdquo; or, what is the same
thing, by only giving round numbers. The Brooklyn Suspension Bridge is
5989&nbsp;feet long, and the Forth Bridge, which crosses the Firth of Forth
in Scotland, is 8296&nbsp;feet long. Now, instead of saying that the former
is <em>about</em> 5000&nbsp;feet long, why not say 5989&nbsp;feet<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;81">&zwnj;</span><a name="p81" id="p81"></a> long? [(5) <i>L</i>ong (9)
<i>B</i>ridge (8) O<i>f</i> (9) <i>B</i>rooklyn.] And instead of saying that the latter
is <em>about or somewhere in the neighbourhood</em> of 8000&nbsp;feet long, why not
be exact and say 8296&nbsp;feet long? [(8) <i>F</i>orth&#8217;s (2) <i>N</i>ew (9) <i>B</i>ridge
(6) <i>Sh</i>own. It was completed in 1890.]</p>

<p>No one who has not had experience in dealing with thousands of poor
memories, as I have had, can realise the fact that in most cases of poor
memories <em>the facts themselves are often possessed</em>, but are mostly
<em>unrecallable</em> when wanted. I have tried to teach pupils how to find
analytic date or number words <em>without any previous training in <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>,
<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></em>, and 99 of all such attempts have always been failures.
The 100th case, which succeeded, only confirmed the rule. On the other
hand, I have always found that these failures become successes after a
thorough practical training in <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, such as I have
already given. In fact, I never had a pupil who became proficient in the
use of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, who did not arrive at the use of analytic
number words without any specific directions from me. But I think, on
the whole, that it is the better way to <em>combine</em> direct and specific
training in analytic number words, with a previous exhaustive general
drill in <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>The rules hereafter given must be carefully studied and every example
painstakingly examined. After studying my formulas let the pupil
endeavour in <em>each case</em> to find a better one himself. If the pupil acts
on my advice, he will know how to be always <em>sure</em> to think of the
needful related or including facts for finding analytic date words,
phrases, or sentences.</p>

<p>The different processes for dealing with dates or numbers may be
classified as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <em>Cases where the name of the person, fact, or event gives its date</em>;
as, Birth of the colored orator and politician Frederick <i>D</i>ou<i>g</i>lass
(18)17. This kind of a case is of rare occurrence, and it would be like
the charlatanry which has disgraced many former memory systems to allow
the pupil to suppose that it frequently happens. A glance at the event,
word, or description will quickly tell him if it represents the
necessary figures, and if it do not, he must resort to an analytic date
word, or phrase, or sentence, whichever he finds most suitable for him.
No one figure alphabet contains<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;82">&zwnj;</span><a name="p82" id="p82"></a> the advantages of all others. Each has
special advantages in special cases. Whatever figure alphabet, however,
is used, the main thing about it is to master it thoroughly.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Cases where a significant or analytic word or phrase expresses the
date or number.</em> &ldquo;I<i>l</i>l-u<i>s</i>a<i>g</i>e&rdquo; expresses the date of the death of
Columbus in 1506, as he died in great neglect. The impetuous pupil says:
&ldquo;How can I be sure that this phrase applies to Columbus? Would it not
apply to any one who had been ill-used?&rdquo; Certainly not. It applies only
to an ill-used man whose date (birth or death, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) was in 1506. If he
knows of some other man who was greatly ill-used and who died in 1506,
then he must use another analytic phrase for that man. See next
paragraph.</p>

<p>Six distinguished persons were born in 1809, yet the date of the birth
of each is easily fixed: Darwin, whose principal work was called &ldquo;Origin
of Species;&rdquo; Gladstone, noted for his vigorous eloquence; Lincoln, who
was conspicuous as a binder together of separated States; Tennyson, who
was chosen as Poet-Laureate, and who was born at Somersby, England;
Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, who early displayed a musical genius, and
whose first oratorio was called &ldquo;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul;&rdquo; Elizabeth Barrett Browning
[<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n&eacute;e</i> Elizabeth Barrett], whose poems are distinguished for their
subjectivity. The analytic formulas for these different persons born in
the same year, 1809, may each differ from the others, thus:</p>

<p>(3) <em>Cases where the initial consonants of a short sentence analytically
express the date.</em></p>

<p>The analytic number words, phrases, and sentences which one retains most
easily are those which he has made himself. Formulas prepared by others
are perfectly retained, however, if they are thoroughly <em>assimilated</em>.</p>

<p><em>The analytic word or phrase is what one most usually finds and uses.</em>
Sentences will sometimes be useful because they may contain the name of
the event, and they sometimes offer a wider range for selection of the
needed consonants; but care must be taken to avoid ambiguity. To
indicate the birth of Lincoln, we might use this formula: (1) <i>D</i>awn (8)
o<i>f</i> (0) A<i>s</i>sassinated (9) <i>P</i>resident, but as Garfield was also
assassinated, the formula in its <em>meaning</em> would equally apply to the
latter. If, however, we know that Garfield was born in 1831, the
ambiguity would be removed. (1) <i>D</i>awn (8) o<i>f</i> (0) A<i>s</i>sassinated (9)
A<i>b</i>raham could apply only to Lincoln. (1) <i>D</i>awn (8) o<i>f</i> (0)
<i>S</i>lavery&#8217;s (9) <i>P</i>resident would be applicable to the career of
Buchanan, Pierce and Fillmore, but it would express the birth-date only
of Lincoln, while it would be wholly inapplicable to his career. (1)
<i>D</i>awn (8) o<i>f</i> (0) <i>S</i>lavery&#8217;s (9) <i>P</i>unisher would exclusively apply
to Lincoln&#8217;s life and birth-date.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">

<i>R</i>o<i>v</i>e,&rdquo; or (2) &ldquo;<i>N</i>oah (3) <i>M</i>ay (48) A<i>r</i>ri<i>v</i>e,&rdquo; are analytic
sentences where <em>all the sounded consonants</em> are used. But a greater
<em>variety</em> of sentences might be found, or <em>one</em> sentence be more readily
found in the first instance if only the <em>initial</em> consonants are used:
as, (2) <i>N</i>oah&#8217;s (3) <i>M</i>enagerie (4) A<i>r</i>k (8) <i>F</i>ull, or (2) <i>N</i>oah (3)
<i>M</i>ade (4) A<i>r</i>arat<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;84">&zwnj;</span><a name="p84" id="p84"></a> (8) <i>F</i>amous, or (2) <i>N</i>oah&#8217;s (3) <i>M</i>arvellous (4)

specific analytic phrases for this event may easily be found by the
student.</p>

<p>The superiority of analytic phrases where <em>all</em> the sounded consonants
are used, over the analytic sentences, where only the initial consonants
are employed, may be seen in the case of the number of men who enlisted
in behalf of the Federal Government in the late war. The number was <em>two
millions, three hundred and twenty thousand, eight hundred and
fifty-four</em>. By initial consonants we have, (2) A<i>n</i>y (3) <i>M</i>an (2)
<i>n</i>ow (0) i<i>s</i> (8) a <i>f</i>ull (5) <i>l</i>oyal (4) He<i>r</i>o. By all the sounded
consonants we have&mdash;&ldquo;I<i>n</i>hu<i>m</i>a<i>n</i> Ci<i>v</i>i<i>l</i> Wa<i>r</i>;&rdquo; the latter shorter,
more significant, and more easily remembered. And, on the principle that
a condensed, brief statement, if clear and definite, makes a more vivid
impression than a longer one, we shall find that a short analytic phrase
is better for the memory than an analytic sentence, and an analytic
single word than a phrase. But a short analytic phrase, or a short
analytic sentence, is usually necessary, owing to our ignorance of the
subject matter, the limitations which belong to all figure alphabets,
and our neglect to act strictly on the lines of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>(4) <em>Cases where there is no direct relation between the person, fact,
or event, and the date, or number word or words.</em> In such cases,
Synthesis, which is taught hereafter, develops an <em>indirect</em> relation.
Synthesis is used in three cases: (1) Where there is no relation
<em>existing</em> between the fact or event and its date word; (2) Where <em>we
are ignorant</em> of all the facts which would give us significant or
analytic date-words; and (3) where we know the needful pertinent facts
with which analytic words could be formed, but we cannot<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;85">&zwnj;</span><a name="p85" id="p85"></a> <em>recall</em> them
for use. In these three cases Synthesis must be used. I will now give
and illustrate the rules for the prompt finding of <em>analytic date or
number words</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>preparation</em> for thus remembering numbers without effort is the
only exertion required. When the method is mastered, the <em>application</em>
of it is made with the greatest ease and pleasure.</p>

<p>There are four indispensable requisites to finding analytic date and
number words promptly.</p>

<p>(1) <strong class="smcap">Such a Mastery of the figure alphabet that the consonant equivalents
of the cipher and nine digits are at instant command, and never have to
be looked up when you have to deal with figures.</strong></p>

<p>Pumps were invented in 1425. A student who thinks 2 is to be translated
by &ldquo;m&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;n,&rdquo; translates the dates by these phrases, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i>,
&ldquo;Drum a whale,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Trim oil,&rdquo; or &ldquo;To ram a wall.&rdquo; As these phrases
sustain the relation neither of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> to the fact, they are
hard to be remembered; and if remembered, they mislead. The student who
has mastered the Fig. Alphabet remembers that &ldquo;n&rdquo; stands for 2, and if
he knows the object of pumps, he at once finds the analytic phrase,
&ldquo;Drain a well.&rdquo; The formula would be: &ldquo;The pump invented&mdash;<i>Dr</i>ai<i>n</i> a
we<i>l</i>l (1425),&rdquo; or (1) Wa<i>t</i>er (4) <i>r</i>aised (2) i<i>n</i> a (5) ho<i>l</i>low. How
could he forget the date?</p>

<p>Tea was first used in Europe in 1601. The unobserving student imagines
that 6 is translated by g<sup>hard</sup>, k, c<sup>hard</sup>, q, or ng, and so he
translates 1601 into &ldquo;Ou<i>tc</i>a<i>st</i>,&rdquo; (1701); a mistake of 100 years, and,
besides, &ldquo;Outcast&rdquo; is wholly unconnected with the introduction of tea
into Europe. The genuine student knows that 6 is represented by sh, j,
ch, or g<sup>soft</sup>, and so he at once finds the analytic formula: &ldquo;Tea
first introduced into Europe&mdash;<i>T</i>ea <i>ch</i>e<i>st</i> (1601).&rdquo; The figure
phrase bears the relation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> to the event, and cannot be
forgotten. Besides many people<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;86">&zwnj;</span><a name="p86" id="p86"></a> believe that tea helps digestion, and
such persons would find an analytic date-word thus: &ldquo;Tea first used in
Europe&mdash;<i>D</i>i<i>g</i>e<i>st</i> (1601).&rdquo;</p>

</ol>

<p>&ldquo;C<sup>soft</sup>&rdquo; is often mistaken for &ldquo;c<sup>hard</sup>&rdquo; by careless learners.
Fulton&#8217;s steamboat &ldquo;Clermont&rdquo; was launched in 1807. Such a pupil
translates that date by the phrase, &ldquo;<i>D</i>e<i>f</i>ie<i>s</i> i<i>c</i>e&rdquo; (1800). Here
&ldquo;c&rdquo; is soft and represents a cipher and not 7. &ldquo;<i>D</i>e<i>f</i>y a <i>sc</i>ow&rdquo; gives
the exact date. Here the &ldquo;c&rdquo; is hard and represents 7, and as the
steamboat could easily outrun the &ldquo;scow,&rdquo; the phrase is easily
remembered.</p>

<p>An impatient pupil who never learns anything thoroughly often disregards
the rule about <em>silent</em> consonants. Braddock and most of his men were
killed by the Indians in 1755. This date this pupil translates by the
phrase, &ldquo;Dock knell all&rdquo; (17255). He overlooks the fact that 17 was
expressed by &ldquo;Dock,&rdquo; and no one out of a mad-house can tell how he came
to add &ldquo;knell all,&rdquo; unless he had forgotten that he had provided for the
7 of 17, and imagined that &ldquo;k&rdquo; in knell is sounded. But how account for
&ldquo;n&rdquo; to introduce 2? A genuine pupil would find the analytic phrase in
&ldquo;<i>Th</i>ey <i>k</i>i<i>l</i>l a<i>l</i>l&rdquo; <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: This instance, unlike the others, had square brackets in the original.">(1755)</ins>.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson, the seventh President, died in 1845. The unindustrious
pupil imagines that &ldquo;p&rdquo; represents 8, and not &ldquo;f&rdquo; or &ldquo;v,&rdquo; and translates
1845 into &ldquo;<i>T</i>o <i>p</i>ou<i>r</i> oi<i>l</i>&rdquo; (1945). The diligent student finds an
analytic translation of the date in the phrase &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>f</i>a<i>r</i>ewe<i>l</i>l&rdquo;
(1845).</p>

<p>These illustrations are sufficient to convince any one that the Figure
Alphabet must be <em>mastered</em> before the attempt is made to deal with
dates and numbers.</p>

<p>(2) <strong class="smcap">The pupil must possess such a mastery of the subject matter that he
can instantly recall facts relating thereto on the lines of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>,

<p>It is said that there are 1,750 spoken languages. If the pupil does not
know that the tongue is moved in different ways to pronounce the
distinctive sounds of different languages, he might not think of this
analytic translation of (1750), &ldquo;<i>T</i>o<i>ng</i>ue a<i>l</i>l way<i>s</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The population of Kentucky according to the last census (1880) was
1,648,690. Those who do not know the Kentuckians raise fine saddle and
race horses, many of which are bays, might not think of the analytic
phrases, &ldquo;<i>T</i>ea<i>ch</i>e<i>r</i> o<i>f</i> <i>sh</i>owy <i>b</i>ay<i>s</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>T</i>ea<i>ch</i>e<i>r</i> o<i>f</i> a

<p>The estimated number of horses in the world is 58,576,322. Those who do
not know how cruelly coachmen often treat the horses under their charge
might not think of the analytic phrase, &ldquo;Wi<i>l</i>l <i>f</i>ee<i>l</i> <i>c</i>oa<i>chm</i>e<i>n</i>
<i>n</i>ow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Yellowstone National Park contains 2,294,740&nbsp;acres. One who does not
know that this park was recently created, might not think of the
analytic phrase, &ldquo;O<i>n</i>e <i>N</i>ew <i>P</i>a<i>rk</i> a<i>r</i>o<i>s</i>e.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The U.&nbsp;S. Government paid out in the year 1865 the sum of
$1,297,555,324. If one wished to remember the exact figures, he could
easily find an analytic phrase, if he thinks of the act of delivering or
handing over the money, as &ldquo;<i>Th</i>ey u<i>np</i>a<i>ck</i> <i>l</i>oya<i>l</i>ly a<i>l</i>l
<i>m</i>o<i>n</i>ey he<i>r</i>e.&rdquo; If any analytic phrase is long or awkwardly
constructed, it is very easy to memorise it by the analytic-synthetic
method; as (1) They unpack. (2) They unpack <em>money</em>. (3) They unpack
money <em>here</em>. (4) They unpack <em>all</em> money here. (5) They unpack <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original did not italicise this word."><em>loyally</em></ins>
all money here.</p>

<p>The number of letters delivered in Great Britain during the postal year
of 1881&ndash;82 was 1,280,636,200. If the student knows that the Central Post
Office of London is a very large building, he could instantly find the
analytic phrase, &ldquo;Wi<i>th</i>i<i>n</i> o<i>f</i>fi<i>c</i>e hu<i>g</i>e <i>m</i>u<i>ch</i> <i>n</i>ew<i>s</i> we
<i>s</i>ee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The amount lost annually by fire in the United States is estimated at
$112,853,784. If we do not go outside of the subject matter of losses
by fire, we shall readily find an analytic phrase by means of which we
can certainly<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;88">&zwnj;</span><a name="p88" id="p88"></a> remember that large number of dollars&mdash;&ldquo;A <i>d</i>eb<i>t</i> o<i>n</i>

<p>There are 653,020 Freemasons in U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. Those who know what is meant by
the phrase, &ldquo;From labor to refreshment,&rdquo; in the masonic ritual, will at
once translate those figures into the analytic phrase, &ldquo;<i>J</i>o<i>l</i>ly
<i>M</i>a<i>s</i>o<i>ns</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are 591,800 Odd Fellows in the United States. Notice if you can
find figures to translate &ldquo;Odd&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; or any other fact
pertaining to the Order, and you have the analytic phrase, &ldquo;A<i>l</i>l
ha<i>p</i>py &lsquo;O<i>d</i>d&rsquo; <i>f</i>a<i>c</i>e<i>s</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There have been granted 428,212 patents in the United States. Can you

<p>The number of Indians in the United States is estimated as 241,329.
Considering how unkindly treated many of them have been, we find an

<p>The population of the state of New York in 1880 was five millions,
eighty-two thousand, eight hundred and seventy-one (5,082,871). An
analytic phrase founded on any conspicuous characteristic of the
population, or on any prominent aspect of the geography of the State
[Niagara Falls, for instance], which many of its people have witnessed,
would suffice, or &ldquo;A (5) <i>L</i>egal (0) <i>C</i>ensus (8) O<i>f</i> (2) <i>N</i>ew-York&#8217;s

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;90">&zwnj;</span><a name="p90" id="p90"></a><strong class="smcap">Remarks.</strong>&mdash;The pupil is presumed to have learned heretofore the series of
Presidents from Washington to Grover Cleveland, and to have recited it
forwards and backwards many times. Now let him learn the dates of their
accession to office, and then let him recite the series both ways in
connection with those dates several times: as, George Washington, 1789;
John Adams, 1797; Thomas Jefferson, 1801, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to Grover Cleveland,
1893 and then back to Washington. Although it is much better for the
pupil to find his own analytic date-words, yet, as many may not have the
time to do so while studying this lesson, I append a few explanations of
the facts on which the above analytic date-words are founded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fabian&rsquo; was applied to the military tactics of Washington, on some
occasions, when he imitated the policy of Quintus Fabius Maximus
Verrucosus, a Roman General who not daring to hazard a battle against
Hannibal, harassed his army by marches, counter-marches, and
ambuscades.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bickerings&rdquo; were incessant during John Adams&#8217;s
administration between his own supporters and the faction of Hamilton.
&ldquo;Steed&rdquo;&mdash;Jefferson rode on horseback to the Capitol to take his oath of
office as President. Arrived there he dismounted and fastened his steed
to an elm-tree, since known as Jefferson&#8217;s tree. He did this to
signalise his disapprobation of royalty, and his preference for
democratic equality. &ldquo;Speculative&rdquo; were the celebrated &ldquo;Madison Papers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Doctrine&rdquo;&mdash;the Monroe doctrine declared that no foreign power should
acquire additional dominion in America. &ldquo;Unlucky&rdquo; was correctly applied
to John Quincy Adams&#8217;s administration. See Barnes&#8217;s U.&nbsp;S. <abbr title="History">His.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;175.
&ldquo;Unwhipped&rdquo;&mdash;Jackson always came off victorious in all his duels and
military campaigns. &ldquo;Mocked&rdquo;&mdash;Van Buren was appointed by Jackson as
U.&nbsp;S. Minister to England. The United States Senate rejected his
nomination. This political insult secured much sympathy for him, and
helped to make him President. &ldquo;Hard-cider&rdquo; was a party watchword during
Harrison&#8217;s campaign for the Presidency. &ldquo;Rudderless&rdquo;&mdash;Tyler often
changed his political views, and finally turned against the United
States Government, of which he had been Chief Executive.
&ldquo;Realm-extender&rdquo;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;91">&zwnj;</span><a name="p91" id="p91"></a>&mdash;during Polk&#8217;s administration the United States
acquired the territory embracing California, Arizona, New Mexico, and
Texas. &ldquo;Warproof&rdquo;&mdash;Taylor was a successful warrior.
&ldquo;Licenser&rdquo;&mdash;Fillmore&#8217;s administration passed the Fugitive Slave Law,
which enabled the Southern masters to recapture runaway slaves.
&ldquo;Looming&rdquo;&mdash;during Pierce&#8217;s term the cloud of civil war was looming up in
the distance. &ldquo;Lecompton&rdquo; constitution of Kansas was a pro-slavery
document which Buchanan favoured. &ldquo;Agitation&rdquo; preceded and attended
Lincoln&#8217;s inauguration, and finally culminated in the civil war.
&ldquo;Shall&rdquo;&mdash;Johnson made use of the imperative &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in regard to the
removal of Edwin M. Stanton, for which attempt he was afterward sought
to be impeached. &ldquo;Chapultepec&rdquo; was the battle in which Grant entered
upon that career of military achievement which secured him two
Presidential terms. &ldquo;Cocoa&rdquo; was characteristic of the drinks allowed at
Hayes&#8217;s table at the White House. No wine was tolerated. &ldquo;Fatal&rdquo; was
Guiteau&#8217;s shot to Garfield. &ldquo;After&rdquo;&mdash;although Tyler, Fillmore, Johnson,
and Arthur became Presidents on the death of their chiefs, yet only
Arthur succeeded to the Presidency in 1881, which is indicated by the
first two consonants of &ldquo;After.&rdquo; &ldquo;Flood&rdquo;&mdash;Cleveland vetoed an
unprecedented number of bills during his term. There was a &ldquo;flood&rdquo; of
them. &ldquo;Fibrous&rdquo; applies metaphorically to mental qualities; it means
strong, sinewy&mdash;high talents, just below genius. &ldquo;Boom&rdquo; refers, of
course, to the large amount of support which Cleveland obtained on his
second election to the Presidency.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;95">&zwnj;</span><a name="p95" id="p95"></a>If you know that the number of square<a name="Anchor-G" id="Anchor-G"></a><a href="#Footnote-G" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote G."><span> Footnote </span>[G]</a> miles in the area of the State
of New York runs into <em>thousands</em>, and you wish to remember that the
<em>exact number</em> of thousands is 47, you could accomplish this object if
you found a word which spells 47, and is at the same time connected by
<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> to New York. You try the varieties of Inclusion; and
in synonymous Inclusion you find 47 in the word &ldquo;Yo<i>rk</i>&rdquo; itself, the &ldquo;y&rdquo;
having no figure value, and &ldquo;r&rdquo; standing for 4, and &ldquo;k&rdquo; for 7; thus you
cannot <em>see</em> the name of New York or <em>think of it</em> without having
conclusive evidence of the number of thousands of square miles the State
contains.</p>

<p>The title of a subject, the name or description of an event or date, can
always be safely abridged or bracketed in part in the formula, as 47
[New] Yo<i>rk</i>. But no one could imagine that &ldquo;York&rdquo; in this connection
[47&nbsp;thousand square miles] means any of the towns or country seats of
the United States which are called &ldquo;York.&rdquo; If the context makes an
otherwise indefinite thing definite, it is sufficient.</p>

<p><em>Analytic date and number words do not have to be memorised.</em>&mdash;Seeing is
believing, and, in this case, <em>remembering</em> too. If you thoroughly
master my system you can find, in most cases, analytic date and number
words without any difficulty, and by means of them you can remember
<em>thousands</em> of dates and sets of figures, when without the system you
could have remembered only five or ten of them.</p>

<p>Suppose in your haste you failed to notice that &ldquo;York&rdquo; spells 47, and
you then proceed to try Inclusion by Genus and Species; regarding York
as the general word, you would find <em>New</em> York as a species or kind of
York; the same with Yorkshire, Yorktown, York Minster, etc. In this way
you would, if your mastery of the Figure Alphabet were perfect, scarcely
fail to notice that York spells 47; but if you fail, you then try
Inclusion by Whole and Part, and run over the political divisions of the
State until you come to <i>R</i>o<i>ck</i>land County, and there you find in its
first two consonants the letters &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;ck&rdquo; (the equivalent<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;96">&zwnj;</span><a name="p96" id="p96"></a> of &ldquo;k&rdquo; in
sound). These consonants spell 47. You would find the same consonants in
the County of He<i>rk</i>imer.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that from unfamiliarity with the Figure Alphabet, or
from want of considerable practice, you do not succeed in noticing that
<i>R</i>o<i>ck</i>land or He<i>rk</i>imer contains the number 47, you try Inclusion by
Abstract and Concrete, and regarding the State of New York as the
Concrete, and the Abstract or characterizing epithet &ldquo;<i>r</i>o<i>ck</i>y&rdquo; as
applicable to New York, you would then find in that word &ldquo;<i>r</i>o<i>ck</i>y&rdquo; the
number 47.</p>

<p>If you did fail, you would try Exclusion, and you would find nothing
which is the antithesis of the area of New York. You might find,
however, a <em>weak form</em> of Exclusion if you consider that the area is the
surface, and what is below the surface as the opposite of it. In the
latter case you would find in the words &ldquo;E<i>r</i>ie <i>C</i>anal,&rdquo; which is a
great artificial channel running through a part of the State, the
letters &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo; hard, which spell 47. A more exact Exclusion might
be found in the word &ldquo;<i>r</i>i<i>ng</i>,&rdquo; which spells 47. For if we consider the
shape of the boundary of New York we would see that in no vague sense a
ring, as a circle, is the opposite of it.</p>

<p>But suppose that from a chronic absent-mindedness or an overworked
brain, or downright bad physical health or insufficient knowledge of the
system, you failed to see 47 in any of the foregoing cases, you would
try Concurrence. Considering that the State of New York is largely
agricultural, you would find that the implement of farming known as a
&ldquo;<i>R</i>a<i>k</i>e&rdquo; would spell 47; this would be a case of Concurrence. In a
political sense, the word &ldquo;<i>r</i>i<i>ng</i>s&rdquo; gives 47, as New York has been
celebrated for them.</p>

<p>All that the student requires is <em>one</em> analytic word. I have gone
through the varieties of Inclusion, through Exclusion, and Concurrence,
merely to show <em>how to find</em> analytic words and not because more than
one word was necessary.</p>

<p>According to the census report of 1890, the number of square miles of
<em>land</em> in the State of New York is 47,620, or (4) Yo<i>r</i>k&#8217;s (7) A<i>c</i>res
(6) <i>S</i>urely (2) <i>N</i>ot (0) <i>S</i>ubmerged; the number of square miles of

<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;97">&zwnj;</span><a name="p97" id="p97"></a>NUMBER OF SHAKESPEARE&#8217;S PLAYS.</h3>

<p>We will try another case: You want to remember the number of plays that
Shakespeare wrote. You know it is less than 50; but you wish to remember
the exact number&mdash;it was 37. You experiment; you try the varieties of
Inclusion, and among the rest you try Whole and Part; you find in the
first two consonants of the name <i>M</i>a<i>c</i>beth the figures 37; but if you
did not notice that <i>M</i>a<i>c</i>beth afforded you the means of always
remembering that the Shakespeare Plays numbered 37, you would try
Exclusion perhaps. If you look upon the attempt to ascribe the
authorship of the Shakespeare Plays to Bacon as a <i>m</i>o<i>ck</i>ery you would
find in the first two consonants of that word the figures 37 through the
operation of Exclusion; and if you recollect that the character of
Shylock was played with great success at Old Drury, February&nbsp;17, 1741,
by Charles <i>M</i>a<i>c</i>lin, you would find in the first two consonants of his
name the figures 37 through Concurrence.</p>


<h3>DUKE OF WELLINGTON AND NAPOLEON.</h3>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769. As a boy he was finely formed.
&ldquo;<i>Sh</i>a<i>p</i>ely&rdquo; (69) gives his birth-date by <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by <abbr title="Abstract and Concrete">A. and C.</abbr> He evinced
the opposite of the temper usually ascribed to the &ldquo;<i>Sh</i>e<i>p</i>herd-boy&rdquo;
(69)&mdash;a birth-date by <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> &ldquo;<i>Ch</i>a<i>p</i>let&rdquo;&mdash;a wreath or garland <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original read &lsquo;sighed&rsquo;.">signed</ins>
for by him in his ambitious hopes&mdash;expresses his birth-date by <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> His
death occurred in 1821. &ldquo;E<i>nd</i>&rdquo; (21) or <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original lacked an opening quote mark.">&ldquo;</ins>U<i>nd</i>one&rdquo; (21) expresses
his death-date by synonymous Inclusion. &ldquo;<i>N</i>a<i>t</i>ivity&rdquo; (21) indicates it
by <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> Since he died from cancer in the stomach, he could retain very
little food. &ldquo;I<i>nd</i>igestion&rdquo; (21) makes his death-date by <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>Wellington&#8217;s birth, in 1769, may be expressed by &ldquo;<i>Sh</i>ee<i>p</i>-faced&rdquo; (69),
a term his own mother applied to him when a boy. In his childhood, he
was blue-eyed, hawk-nosed, slender, and ungainly, &ldquo;<i>Ch</i>u<i>b</i>by&rdquo; (69), by
<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, expresses his birth-date. A more vivid concurrence can scarcely be
imagined, since he and Bonaparte were both born in the same year, 1769.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;98">&zwnj;</span><a name="p98" id="p98"></a>Wellington died in 1852 at Wilmer Castle. &ldquo;Wi<i>lm</i>er&rdquo; expresses the date
of his death by only one year too many. But a means of remembrance that
requires readjustment or modification can seldom be relied upon, except
by those who are practised in Higher Analysis. He was 83 years old when
he died. &ldquo;<i>L</i>a<i>n</i>tern-jawed&rdquo; (52) expresses his death-date by <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, by <abbr title="Abstract and Concrete">A.
and C.</abbr> No man was ever more honored after his death than Wellington.
&ldquo;A<i>l</i>ie<i>n</i>ated&rdquo; (52) expresses his death-date by <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> A sudden illness
carried him off. Hence &ldquo;I<i>l</i>lness&rdquo; (52) is a fact connected with his
death by <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>These elaborate illustrations must indicate to any student how to apply
the laws of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, so as to find analytic date and number
words. Cases of <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> give good practice, but are rarely ever necessary.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES.</h3>

<p><em>Inclusion</em>, as applied to the events of life possesses the same variety
as in regard to words. In dates of the last and present century, the
expression of the <em>last two figures</em> is sufficient. William Cullen
Bryant was born in 1794. &#8217;94 is found in the name <i>Br</i>yant, a case of
Synonymous Inclusion. Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel in
1804. As we know it was about the beginning of this century, this
translation of the 4 indicates the exact date and is found in Aa<i>r</i>on
and relieves the memory of all doubt.</p>

<li>Why is it not necessary to have a date-word to

</ol>

<p>Sherman made his famous march through the South in 1864. 64 is found in
the word <i>Sh</i>e<i>r</i>man [or by two words: (6) <i>Sh</i>erman (4) <i>R</i>avaging]. In
dates previous to the last century, the last three figures must be
expressed. Movable types were invented in 1438. We know it was not
<span class="allsc">A.D.</span>&nbsp;438, but was 1438; a mistake of 1,000 years is not possible. If we
translate 438 it will mean to us the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;99">&zwnj;</span><a name="p99" id="p99"></a> same as 1438. 438 is found in the
analytic word (438) &ldquo;<i>R</i>e<i>m</i>o<i>v</i>able&rdquo; [or, to express all the numbers,
thus: (1) <i>T</i>ypes (4) a<i>r</i>e (3) <i>m</i>ovable (8) <i>f</i>igures].</p>

<p>The Phonograph was invented in 1877. The expression of 77 is found in
<i>C</i>o<i>g</i>nate, and that indicates the resemblance of the human mechanism
to receive sounds to the Phonograph; for both processes utilize
vibrations, and are therefore from similarity of functions &ldquo;Cognate&rdquo;
methods. How any one could forget analytic date-words is more than I can
understand, especially when formed by himself.</p>

</ol>

<p><em>Exclusion.</em>&mdash;The first steamship crossed the Atlantic in 1819. 19 is
found in &ldquo;<i>T</i>u<i>b</i>&rdquo; by Exclusion, as the most opposite to a steam-driven
ship. Andrew Johnson was advanced to the Presidency on the death of
Abraham Lincoln in 1865. 65 is expressed by Exclusion in the word
&ldquo;<i>Sh</i>e<i>l</i>ved,&rdquo; which means the opposite of promotion [or by two words,
thus: (6) <i>J</i>ohnson (5) E<i>l</i>evated]. &ldquo;<i>M</i>e<i>n</i>dacious&rdquo; expresses by
Exclusion the birth of George Washington in 1732, as indicating a
youthful quality the opposite of that which he manifested, and by two
words: (3) A<i>m</i>erica&#8217;s (2) I<i>n</i>fant. Other examples are given in
subsequent pages.</p>

<p><em>Concurrence</em> finds incidents or concomitants of a fact or event,
something that by accident became connected with it. It may be a
forerunner or successor, the cause or consequence, or a contemporaneous
fact, etc.</p>

<p>William Cullen Bryant, from a fall, died in 1878. The last two figures
78 are found by Concurrence in the initial consonants of the phrase &ldquo;(7)
<i>C</i>ullen&#8217;s (8) <i>F</i>all.&rdquo; Cullen will be easily identified, as the middle
name of Bryant. When Jefferson became Vice-President, in 1797, he wore
the customary big-wig; and the first two consonants of &ldquo;<i>B</i>i<i>g</i>-wig&rdquo;
express by Concurrence that date.</p>

<p>Artillery was invented in 1340. 340 indicates that date, and by
Concurrence we find those figures in the first three consonants of
&ldquo;<i>M</i>e<i>rc</i>iless.&rdquo; Or (3) <i>M</i>urderous (4) A<i>r</i>tillery&#8217;s (0) <i>S</i>courge.
Plymouth (Mass.) was settled in 1620. 620 will indicate it. We find
these figures in &ldquo;<i>Ch</i>a<i>nc</i>e,&rdquo;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;100">&zwnj;</span><a name="p100" id="p100"></a> which by Concurrence describes the risk
they ran. The Telephone was invented in 1877. Whoever has listened to
the telephone to identify a speaker, and heard others talking in the
shrill tones that strike upon the ear, is apt to think of the cackling
of hens, and &ldquo;<i>C</i>a<i>ck</i>le&rdquo; expresses the date 77.</p>

<p>Jefferson Davis disguised himself in the hood, shawl, and dress of his
wife in 1865. &ldquo;<i>Sh</i>aw<i>l</i>&rdquo; by Concurrence expresses that date. The
Constitution of the United States was <em>adopted</em> in 1787, which spells
&ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>G</i>i<i>v</i>i<i>ng</i>.&rdquo; To adopt the Constitution, it required the States
to give their assent. They <em>gave</em> the Federal Government all the power
it possessed. &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>G</i>i<i>v</i>i<i>ng</i>&rdquo; is therefore a case of Concurrence. A
circumstance connected with settlements is <em>selecting</em> the site.
Jamestown, <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr>, was settled in 1607, which spells &ldquo;<i>Th</i>e <i>Ch</i>oosi<i>ng</i>.&rdquo;
This phrase relates to the settlement by Concurrence. Harvard College
was founded in 1636, which spells &ldquo;<i>T</i>ea<i>ch</i> <i>M</i>u<i>ch</i>.&rdquo; Whether we take
this phrase as describing the object or result of founding that college,
it is a case of Concurrence. A college is sometimes called a seat of
learning. Yale College was founded in 1701, which spells &ldquo;<i>T</i>oo<i>k</i> a
<i>s</i>ea<i>t</i>.&rdquo; This phrase describes the locating of the college, and is
therefore a relation by Concurrence.</p>

<p>(4) <strong class="smcap">The pupil must seek <em>analytic</em> words which are <em>approximately
specific</em>, as birth-date words must, where possible, relate to birth or
juvenile events; marriage-date words, to events connected nearly or
remotely with the marriage; date words for any other event in life or
fact in history should, directly or <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original read &lsquo;indirecly&rsquo;.">indirectly</ins>, relate to such event
or fact; and, finally, death-date words should refer to incidents which
preceded, accompanied, or followed the fact of the death.</strong></p>

<p>This rule, theoretically correct, must be very liberally interpreted in
practice. This lesson furnishes numerous illustrative examples.</p>

<p>As shown heretofore, <em>the pupil must know the facts</em>, and the System
will then help him to fix their date.</p>

<p>A pupil had loaned money to a horse-dealer who lived at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 715 of a
certain street. He knew the house well, yet<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;101">&zwnj;</span><a name="p101" id="p101"></a> he could not recollect the
number 715. At length he thought of &ldquo;<i>C</i>a<i>t</i>t<i>l</i>e&rdquo; as a figure word to
enable him to remember the number. Yet the word is general and
apparently unconnected with the house, as it was not a stable but a
boarding-house. Yet, as cattle and horse are species of the genus
domestic animal, and cattle would recall horses and horse-dealer, he did
right to use that term, and it served him well. At first he instantly
recalled the word &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; whenever he thought of the horse-dealer&#8217;s
residence, and at once 715 was given him. After a time, he directly
recalled 715 without first thinking of &ldquo;cattle.&rdquo; This is always the case
where the method is applied. It is soon no longer required in that case.
When this pupil told me what he had done, I asked him why he had not
used the phrase &ldquo;(7) <i>C</i>ollect (1) <i>Th</i>e (5) <i>L</i>oan,&rdquo; which was the
object he had in view in thinking of, or of sending to, that address.
His reply was that &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; served his purpose. With one person a single
word, with another a phrase, and with another a sentence, is most
serviceable. He had other borrowers who lived at other places. Why could
this phrase &ldquo;Collect the loan,&rdquo; which would apply in its meaning to the
case of others, remind him of this particular debtor&#8217;s home? Because, if
he had consciously devised that phrase to identify this debtor&#8217;s
address, it could apply in his mind to the address of no other debtor.
Thus the <em>facts help us devise the number phrase, and the phrase helps
revive the facts</em>.</p>

<p>I do not, for instance, undertake in this lesson to teach the pupil that
Washington never left America but once, when he accompanied his invalid
brother to Barbadoes in 1751, in search of health. But if he knows these
facts, my method helps him retain the date, by using those facts for
this purpose; as, (1) <i>T</i>o (7) <i>G</i>ain (5) Is<i>l</i>and (1) <i>T</i>onic; or
(17)51 Hea<i>lth</i>. We know that &ldquo;health&rdquo; is an object with everybody in
all countries and in all ages, and is therefore a word of the most
general character and of the most extended application. How, then, can
it have any <em>special</em> significance in this case? Because by knowing the
facts, in the first place, as &ldquo;health&rdquo; was the object of the visit of
Washington and his brother; and seeking for a date word which spells
(17)51, the pupil has discovered that this<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;102">&zwnj;</span><a name="p102" id="p102"></a> general word &ldquo;health&rdquo; spells
that date; and, as the pupil has applied the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; to this date
and to no other, he has thus made the general word specific for his
purpose. Because &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; is a health promoter, and &ldquo;island&rdquo; is a help to
recall the specific Islands of Barbadoes, the phrase (1) &ldquo;<i>T</i>o (7)
<i>G</i>ain (5) Is<i>l</i>and (1) <i>T</i>onic,&rdquo; is more specific than &ldquo;health.&rdquo; But
either the single word or phrase becomes specific, if the facts of the
case are assimilated, and then by the pupil are applied to furnish a
date word.</p>


<h4>BIOGRAPHY, HISTORY, AND SCIENCE.</h4>

<p>Much of the substance and pith of historic eras can be expressed in the
analytic words, phrases, or sentences with which their dates are
enunciated. If the foregoing and subsequent examples are carefully, not
hurriedly, studied, the student can readily hereafter retain a great
deal of the significance of facts, events, or epochs by his infallible
recollection of the analytic expression of their dates. As with history,
so with the arts and science, etc.</p>

<h3>EARLY TRAINING IN FIGURES.</h3>

<p>If the mind-wandering mode of <em>rote</em> learning is no longer practised,
but an <em>assimilating</em> method is substituted for it; if we abolish the
&ldquo;mind-wrecking&rdquo; procedure of forcing immature minds into and through
studies which they cannot comprehend, and which, therefore, create
chronic habits of Inattention; and if the idea of numbers and their
elementary processes are <em>objectively</em> taught, until habits of sure
enumeration and calculation are formed, then, when the child reaches
maturity, he will rarely if ever require any conscious aid in
remembering a series of 2, 3, 4, or more figures.</p>

<p>Meantime, a thorough training in this system tends to do<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;107">&zwnj;</span><a name="p107" id="p107"></a> away with the
injurious effects of false mental habits; to set the Memory and
Attention at work in a natural way, and greatly strengthen both; and
while learning a large number of dates in a short time, or many figures
in one series may still require the use of the System, unless the
Numeric Thinking prior to this chapter has been mastered, yet, in the
ordinary way of meeting figures in reading, study, or business, there
will seldom occur any <em>necessity</em> for resorting to the method taught in
this lesson.</p>


<h3>WHAT MUST BE DONE FOR AN ACQUIRED ATTENTION.</h3>

<p>In the case of those who have not inherited, but who have <em>acquired</em>, a
great power of Attention, a decided <em>benefit</em> will ensue, however, if
throughout life they occasionally use the System in regard to numbers
and in learning prose and poetry by the Analytic-Synthetic and
Interrogative Analysis Methods.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Will a pupil always require an aid to remember figures?</li>
<li>What is required of him in order to enable him to do away with any
<em>conscious</em> aid?</li>
<li>What does a thorough training in my system accomplish in the meantime?</li>
<li>Will there ever be any <em>necessity</em> of using the figure alphabet?</li>
<li>Will not a decided benefit ensue to those who have acquired a great
power of attention?</li>
</ol>

<p>Where a great power of Attention has been renewed or originally
acquired, it requires considerable effort to <em>continue</em> that power. The
unnumbered objects of thought which civilization constantly brings
before the mind, without giving any opportunity for a mastery of many of
them; the fierce rivalries of interest, and the enervating habits of
body which are constantly being formed or perpetuated&mdash;all alike and
together tend to break down an acquired power of Attention. It is said
that Alexander Hamilton used to go through the demonstrations of
Euclid&#8217;s Geometry before the commencement of each Session of the early
Congress. For what purpose? In order to be able to make use of
geometrical knowledge in debate? Certainly not. He reviewed this study
to stiffen the back-bone of his power of Attention. And he possessed
this power in an extraordinary degree by nature. I am not suggesting
any such severe course of self-discipline. But if the pupil<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;108">&zwnj;</span><a name="p108" id="p108"></a> whose
<em>attention was formerly weak</em> will never allow a date to come before him
without fixing it in mind by my method, and if he will also occasionally
learn by heart a passage of prose or poetry by my <em>assimilating</em>
methods, he will train his Attention in a pleasanter and more effective
way than Hamilton did his by his studies in Euclid&mdash;besides making
himself conspicuously accurate where most men are notoriously
inaccurate.</p>

<p>[It is a most misleading mistake to suppose that the principles of the
following or either of the previous chapters are to be <em>consciously and
constantly</em> used by the pupil, whether he be a student or a man of
business. It is only used at all during the training period&mdash;rarely
afterwards. But during the training period, I desire the pupil to make
as much use of the devices and principles of the system as he possibly
can&mdash;and the more he uses them the sooner he no longer has occasion to
use them.]</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Does it require any effort to <em>continue</em> that power?</li>
<li>What tends to break down an acquired power of attention?</li>
<li>What suggestion is here given the pupil in regard to this?</li>

<small>CONNECTING THE UNCONNECTED.</small></h2>


<p>A Congressman could not remember the name of Zachary Taylor, the twelfth
President of the United States, but he could always readily recall his
nick-name, &ldquo;Rough and Ready.&rdquo; In this case there was no <em>revivable</em>
connection established in his mind between the <em>name</em> Zachary Taylor and
the idea or image of the <em>man</em> known as Zachary Taylor&mdash;but there <em>was</em>
a revivable connection in his mind between the name &ldquo;Rough and Ready&rdquo;
and the idea or image of that man. Now the thing to be done to enable
this Congressman to readily recall the name Zachary Taylor was to
<em>establish</em> or <em>make a revivable connection</em> between the name Zachary
Taylor and the image of him, or some characteristic of him, as it was
known to that Congressman; or to connect the well-remembered name &ldquo;Rough
and Ready&rdquo; to the usually forgotten name Zachary Taylor. This would be a
<em>device</em> for helping him to revive this hitherto unrecallable name. But
another and better way to aid him would be to <strong class="smcap">strengthen</strong> his <strong class="smcap">reviving
power generally</strong>, so that he could readily recall the name Zachary Taylor
as well as his other previous experiences; for there is no doubt that he
had a <em>record</em> in his mind of the name Zachary Taylor; for whenever he
failed to recall it, he <em>recognised</em> it the moment he saw it, or it was
mentioned in his presence. This proved that he <em>knew</em> the name but could
not <em>revive</em> it.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">

<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;110">&zwnj;</span><a name="p110" id="p110"></a>HOW TO HELP THE MEMORY.</h3>

<p>There are therefore two ways of helping the memory. (1) By a device
resorted to in each separate case to help make a more vivid First
Impression. Nearly all Memory Systems hitherto taught have only been
such Devices; of little benefit except in the cases where they have been
<em>actually applied</em>&mdash;mere temporary appliances, and many of them of
doubtful value, devoid of any strengthening power. (2) By a Method of
Memory <strong class="smcap">Training</strong>. This is the unique character of my System. It is used
as a device during the process of developing the latent powers of the
Memory and the Attention, but the <em>result of its use</em> is to so
strengthen the Memory that, as a Device it is no longer required. As a
trainer my System operates in three ways. (1) It increases the general
<em>Impressionability</em>, so that all First Impressions must be more vivid
than they have ever been before. (2) It increases the general
<em>Revivability</em>, so that First Impressions are more under the control of
the will, and can be afterward recalled when desired. (3) It compels the
Intellect to stay with the senses and thereby it abolishes
mind-wandering.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Did he have a <em>record</em> of the name in his mind?</li>
<li>How many ways are there of helping the memory?</li>
<li>What is the first way?</li>
<li>The second?</li>
<li>What is meant by Memory Training?</li>
<li>What is the unique character of my system?</li>
<li>What is the result of its use?</li>
<li>In how many ways does my system operate as a Trainer?</li>
<li>What are they?</li>
</ol>

<p>A one-sided view of the Memory proclaims that if vivid First Impressions
are made in all cases, that is enough. This opinion implies a limited
acquaintance with the different kind of memories. In some cases where a
person is troubled with chronic forgetfulness, a vivid First Impression
may be received, and no recollection of it will long survive. That a
vivid impression was received is proved by the fact that, shortly after
the occurrence, his memory of the details of it is possibly nearly
perfect, and yet, after the lapse of a few days, or weeks, or months,
the recollection of every trace of the occurrence has vanished. After
the total oblivion of the matter in his waking moments, he will
sometimes recall all the details of the affair in a dream. This is
demonstration irresistible that the trouble in this<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;111">&zwnj;</span><a name="p111" id="p111"></a> case lies, not in
receiving vivid First Impressions, but in the weakness of his reviving
power. In fact, some memories are much oftener weak from deficiency in
reviving power than from feebleness of first impressions. If, however,
Impressionability be increased to the highest degree in all cases, and
Revivability be strengthened to the same extent, all memories will be
good, however bad some of them may theretofore have been in any or in
all respects.</p>


<h3>MODES OF ESTABLISHING CONNECTIONS.</h3>

<p><dfn class="smcap">Recollective Analysis</dfn> is used to memorise a series of words or facts
between every pair of which the relation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> exists. It
equally applies to a single pair of such words or facts.</p>

<p><dfn class="smcap">Recollective Synthesis or Thoughtive Unification</dfn> is used where <em>no
relation exists</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>revivable</em> connection is established in such cases by means of a
Correlation which always consists of one or more unifying intermediates.
And the words, hitherto un-united, which are thus cemented together, are
called Extremes.</p>

<p>We had experience in learning the Series in the first chapter that the
application of the Laws of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> enable us to memorise
those Series in much less time than it would have taken had we not known
<em>how to make use of</em> those Laws. Many people could <em>never</em> have
committed to memory such Series by mere <em>rote</em> or <em>repetition</em>, and not
one in a hundred could have learnt to say them backwards by <em>rote</em>
alone. Yet my Pupils easily learn them both ways, because Analysis
affords the highest possible <strong class="smcap">aid</strong> to the Natural<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;112">&zwnj;</span><a name="p112" id="p112"></a> Memory. In fact, the
<em>deepest</em> and <em>most abiding</em> impression that can be made upon the
Natural Memory is by impressing it with <em>relations</em> of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or
<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>; because these are the Memory-Senses (if the phrase be allowed),
these are the Eyes, Ears, Touch, Taste, and Smell of the Memory: and we
have only to impress the <em>Memory</em> according to the laws of its own
nature and the <em>Memory</em> will <strong class="smcap">retain</strong> the impression. This is exactly what
my Art does: for I translate every case of Synthesis into an Analytic
series by supplying one or more <em>Memory-intermediates</em> that grow out of
the &ldquo;Extremes,&rdquo; each one of which is an instance of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or
<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>&mdash;Thus, every example of Synthesis is a <strong>developed or extended
Analysis</strong>. To make this translation from Synthesis into Analysis requires
no intellectual ingenuity&mdash;no constructive power of imagination&mdash;but
only a <em>recall to consciousness</em>, through <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, of what we
already <em>know</em> about the &ldquo;Extremes.&rdquo; I call a specimen of developed
Analysis a Correlation, because the Intermediates sustain the <em>direct</em>,
<em>immediate</em>, and <em>specific</em> relation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> to the
&ldquo;Extremes&rdquo; (having nothing in common, in principle or nature, with the
old-fashioned Mnemonical &ldquo;Links,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Phrases&rdquo;).</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;113">&zwnj;</span><a name="p113" id="p113"></a>Children and Adults, who have thoroughly learned Recollective Analysis
and practised its exercises, find no difficulty in making Correlations,
unless they are so afflicted with Mind-Wandering that they have never

perversities of early education; but even in these cases the <em>diligent</em>

to correlate any word whatever to any or all the words in any

<h3>ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS COMPARED.</h3>

<p>It is sometimes asked, cannot &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; cement together unconnected
&ldquo;Extremes&rdquo;? This question implies a contradiction of terms. I reply,
&ldquo;Yes, by <em>accident</em>, and by accident only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Analysis is <em>declaratory</em>&mdash;Synthesis is <em>constructive</em>. Analysis
<em>discovers</em> and <em>describes</em> the relations actually existing&mdash;Synthesis
applies connecting intermediates where no relations previously existed,
and then Analysis characterizes the relations introduced by the
cementing intermediates.</p>

<p>Even in the First Exercises the Series are Synthetic.<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;115">&zwnj;</span><a name="p115" id="p115"></a> Every pair of
words of which such Series consists exemplifies the relations either of
Inclusion, Exclusion, or Concurrence. I used to call that Lesson
Recollective Analysis, because in it the pupil is engaged in
familiarising himself with those Laws of Assimilation, and in
<em>discovering</em> and <em>declaring</em> the character of the relations between the
words of such Synthetic Series. He commits to memory such a series by
<em>thinking</em> of the relations between the words. A minor object is to
memorise the Series&mdash;but a greater and higher object never lost sight of
in these Lessons is to train the Memory and Attention. And let the pupil
clearly notice <em>how</em> this training comes about. Merely running over a
Series&mdash;two words at a time&mdash;without discriminating the <em>kind</em> and
<em>quality</em> of the relations between the words&mdash;hoping that the mind
unpractised in the Laws of Assimilation will intuitively feel those
relations, constitutes no training of the Memory. Such reading neither
strengthens the old power nor develops any new power. It is a blind act
of unconscious absorption, however little be absorbed. But if the mind
<em>acts</em> in such cases and <em>tries to find</em> and <em>characterise</em> the
relations, then the appreciation of the relations of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>,
is quickened and invigorated and becomes in time so intensified that
those relations are thereafter almost automatically felt, and the
impression they make on the Memory, henceforth, is the most vivid
possible.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>To whom only does this result come?</li>
<li>What question is frequently asked?</li>
<li>What is the reply?</li>
<li>Is analysis declaratory?</li>
<li>If so, why?</li>
<li>Is Synthesis constructive?</li>
<li>If so, explain why?</li>
<li>Why is the first lesson called <abbr title="Recollective">Rec.</abbr> Analysis?</li>
</ol>

<p>Every Correlation is a Synthetic Series. It can be and should <em>always</em>
be analyzed, but Analysis never makes a Correlation. That is the
function of Synthesis. Since &ldquo;extremes&rdquo; are words with no relation
between them, Analysis cannot find what does not exist. But <em>accident</em>
sometimes makes a <em>spelling</em> or <em>letter</em> relation between the
&ldquo;Extremes,&rdquo; and then Analysis can memorise these &ldquo;extremes&rdquo; by means of
such accidental relations. To illustrate:&mdash;</p>

<p>A physician was troubled to remember on which side of the heart are the
&ldquo;mitral valves.&rdquo; As they are on the left<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;116">&zwnj;</span><a name="p116" id="p116"></a> side of the heart, he might
have noticed that &ldquo;mitral&rdquo; ends with the letter &ldquo;l,&rdquo; and that the word
&ldquo;left&rdquo; begins with the letter &ldquo;l&rdquo;&mdash;as &ldquo;l&rdquo; belongs to both of these
words, here would be a case of analysis. Such a device, however, could
never be erected into a rule, for it is founded on accident only, and
cannot be used in all cases. How much more vivid to many persons in this
example is a Correlation, thus: &ldquo;<em>Mitral valves</em> &hellip; mitred Abbots&hellip;
none left &hellip; <em>left</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To remember which of the University crews wears <em>dark</em> blue and which
<em>light</em>, we can note that the vowel &ldquo;I&rdquo; belongs alike to Cambridge and
&ldquo;Light&rdquo; and is absent from Oxford and &ldquo;Dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Take a case in Trigonometry&mdash;a <em>Complement</em> is what remains after
subtracting an angle from <em>one</em> right-angle. Take 60&nbsp;degrees from
90&nbsp;degrees, and we have the complement 30&nbsp;degrees&mdash;a <em>Supplement</em> is
what remains after subtracting an angle from two right-angles. Take
120&nbsp;degrees from 180&nbsp;degrees and we have the supplement 60&nbsp;degrees. How
to remember that &ldquo;Complement&rdquo; relates to one right-angle, and
&ldquo;Supplement&rdquo; relates to two right-angles, is a difficulty for a poor
memory. Looking at the accidents of the subject, we see that Supplement
and two right-angles have a relation in this, that Supplement begins
with S and two begins with <em>T</em>. S &hellip; T. Hence we must remember that
Supplement relates to <i>T</i>wo right-angles, and, of course, the word
Complement to one right-angle.</p>

<p>Or to use the Synthetic Method: &ldquo;<em>Complement</em> (compliment) &hellip; praise
bestowed &hellip; prize-winner &hellip; won &hellip; <em>one right-angle</em>&rdquo; (<em>Complement</em>
completes right-angle &hellip; <em>one</em> &hellip; <em>right-angle</em>) or &ldquo;<em>Supplement</em> &hellip;
supple &hellip; bend double &hellip; &lsquo;two double&rsquo; &hellip; <em>two right-angles</em>&rdquo;
(<em>Supplement</em> &hellip; added to &hellip; more than one right-angle &hellip; <em>two
right-angles</em>).</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;117">&zwnj;</span><a name="p117" id="p117"></a>I could give many other illustrations of the narrow scope of this Method
of Accidents, though <em>genuine within that scope</em>, and how, in <em>all</em>
cases, by the Synthetic Method we can find in the facts <em>to be
remembered</em> the means of their recollection. One case more: In regard to
memorising the statement that &ldquo;the Posterior Nerve of the Spinal Column
is Sensory, and the Anterior Nerve is Motor,&rdquo; using this Method of
Accidents, &ldquo;You observe that Posterior and Sensory go together, and that
Anterior and Motor go together. The initial letters of Posterior and
Sensory are P and S, and the initial letters of Anterior and Motor are A
and M. By considering that A and M are in the upper part of the Alphabet
and P and S are in the lower part of it, you will be sure to remember
that Anterior is associated with Motor and Posterior with Sensory.&rdquo; I
admit that the <em>first time</em> one hears this elaborate method applied the
novelty of the principle of it might make an impression; but, after
that, the method would probably fail from its lengthy exposition;
because it is difficult to retain the <em>steps of an argument</em> in a weak
Memory and therefore such a method cannot certainly act as a <em>Means for
Aiding</em> the Memory. How do I manage this case? By correlating Posterior
to Sensory, thus: <em>Posterior</em> &hellip; Post-Mortem &hellip; Insensible &hellip;
<em>Sensory</em>; or Anterior to Motor, thus: <em>Anterior</em> &hellip; Ant &hellip; disturbed
anthill &hellip; commotion &hellip; <em>Motor</em>; or <em>Anterior</em> &hellip; antediluvian &hellip;
rush of water &hellip; water-power &hellip; <em>Motor</em>. In uniting the two
unconnected &ldquo;Extremes&rdquo; together by means of a <em>developed Analysis
memorised</em>, the Natural Memory is aided in a very high degree.</p>

<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;118">&zwnj;</span><a name="p118" id="p118"></a>HOW TO MEMORISE A CORRELATION.</h3>

<p>To memorise a Correlation you must <em>at first</em>, if your <em>Natural Memory
be weak</em>, repeat from <em>memory</em> the intermediates forwards and backwards,
as:&mdash;<strong class="smcap">Anchor</strong> &hellip; <em>sheet-anchor</em> &hellip; <em>sheet</em> &hellip; <em>bed</em> &hellip;
<strong class="smcap">Bolster</strong>&mdash;<strong class="smcap">Bolster</strong> &hellip; <em>bed</em> &hellip; <em>sheet</em> &hellip; <em>sheet-anchor</em> &hellip; <strong class="smcap">Anchor</strong>, at
least three times each way. These six repetitions from memory, three
forward and three back, are only required <em>at first</em>. In a short time
you will infallibly remember every Correlation <em>you make</em>; at last, the
memory will become so strong, that you will no longer have to make
Correlations at all. After you have repeated the Correlation, then
repeat the two extremes, thus&mdash;&ldquo;Anchor&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;Bolster.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bolster&rdquo; &hellip;
&ldquo;Anchor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bolster&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;Anchor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anchor&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;Bolster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing else is so easy to memorise as a Correlation, for a Correlation
is not a &ldquo;mental picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;story&rdquo;&mdash;it is neither a proposition,
sentence or phrase. It has no rhetorical, grammatical, argumentative or
<em>imaginative</em> character. It is simply an elemental primordial
Psychological Sequence of Ideas in which one includes another, excludes
another, or in which one idea has been so often or so vividly united
with another in past experience that the two are inseparably connected
in memory&mdash;and a little practice in making and <em>memorising</em> these
Correlations soon makes it <em>impossible</em> to forget them.</p>

<h3>ASSIMILATIVE ASSOCIATION AND MEMORY.</h3>

<p>Probably no psychological mistake was ever fraught with greater injury
to the cause of public or self-education than the too prevalent opinion
amongst teachers generally that &ldquo;physiological retentiveness&rdquo; is the
memory&#8217;s sole reliance <em>in all stages of life</em>. It is nearly the sole
reliance in infancy, and a partial reliance in youth. But when an<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;119">&zwnj;</span><a name="p119" id="p119"></a>
accumulation of experiences and a fair command of language have been
gained, new acquisitions are henceforward principally made by <em>the
affiliation</em> of one idea upon or with another or <em>the making of
associations between ideas already established</em>.</p>

<p>And, if this be so, then memory must be very greatly improvable, since
no mental power is susceptible of so much improvement as assimilative
association.</p>

<p>A good memory, whether natural or acquired, belongs to quick and vivid
<em>associability</em> and <em>revivability</em> rather than to mere inherent and
perpetual physiological <em>record making</em>.</p>

<p>After a certain number of experiences the child learns the appearance of
a square. All his future experiences, however varied, of squares become
affiliated upon, or connected with the record of this original square.
If each new square had to be separately impressed on the brain as a
distinct and independent physiological record, it would take as much
time and trouble to learn every new square as it did to learn the first
square. But the <em>instant</em> recognition of every square after learning the
first one shows that the old brain record is used in the case of each
new experience of squares or that the new square is interpreted by the
old or original record through the Laws of Association. Again: Taking
the prefixes <i>com.</i>, <i>de.</i>, <i>im.</i>, <i>op.</i>, <i>re.</i>, <i>sup.</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, which are
used in thousands of cases, and the suffixes <i>ment</i>, <i>sion</i>, <i>ible</i>,
<i>ibility</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, also used in thousands of words, and using these in
connexion with the root word &ldquo;Press&rdquo; we have compress, depress, impress,
oppress, repress, suppress, and also compressible, depression,
re-impress, suppression, impressment, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Must a new physiological record be made for each form of the sixty or
more words of which Press constitutes the base, and must a new record be
also made for each of the prefixes and suffixes in the thousands of
combinations in which they occur? No one believes any such absurdity.</p>

<p>If space permitted it would be easy to offer additional considerations
tending to show that after infancy and early youth new acquisitions are
mainly made by combinations and recombinations of ideas already
possessed, and not by new and independent records physiologically
reimpressed on each occasion.</p>


<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;120">&zwnj;</span><a name="p120" id="p120"></a>RULES FOR MAKING CORRELATIONS.</h3>

<p>1. Never make a correlation except in conformity to <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>
Carelessness here is fatal to success.</p>

<p>2. When the pupil reads a correlation of mine, he should indicate the
relations between the words by writing in the figures 1, 2, or 3, and he
should pursue the same course with his own correlations.</p>

<p>3. Ofttimes &ldquo;extremes&rdquo; are in different planes of thought, so
occasionally three intermediates are necessary to cement them; two are
often required; but after considerable practice in making correlations
one usually suffices.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>What is fatal to success in making correlations?</li>
<li>What do the figures 1, 2, and 3 indicate in Rule 2?</li>
<li>How many intermediates should there be?</li>
</ol>

<p>4. A correlation is a <em>successive advance</em>, and an intermediate must not
refer back to any except its <em>immediate</em> antecedent, never to its second
or third antecedent. A pupil wrote:&mdash;<em>Short steps</em> &hellip; stepson &hellip; real
son &hellip; more a son &hellip; <em>Morrison</em>. Here, &ldquo;more a son&rdquo; refers to the
comparison between &ldquo;real son&rdquo; and &ldquo;stepson,&rdquo; but the latter is the
second antecedent so the correlation is a defective one. He might have
said: <em>Short steps</em> &hellip; <em>stepson</em> &hellip; <em>Morrison</em>.</p>

<p>5. A word may be used twice but never three times. <em>Pen</em> &hellip; pensive &hellip;
gay &hellip; nosegay &hellip; <em>Nose</em>. Here &ldquo;gay&rdquo; is properly used twice, and after
that, it is dropped and you can go on with the rest of the word, to wit,
<em>nose</em>.</p>

<p>6. A compound phrase including a verb is rarely allowable, since the
intermediates must be the simplest elements, either sensations or
perceptions [relations among sensations] or abstractions [relations
among relations], or one of these with either of the others, always
exemplifying either <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>7. My correlations are good for me, but they may not be so vivid to
others, especially where the concurrences are used. To fix the date of
Magna Charta (1215), the pupil could memorise this Correlation&mdash;<strong class="smcap">Magna
Charta</strong> &hellip;<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;121">&zwnj;</span><a name="p121" id="p121"></a> King John &hellip; Jew&#8217;s teeth &hellip; <strong class="smcap">DeNTaL</strong>. But if the pupil did
not know <em>before</em> that King John had granted that charter, and if he did
not also know the story about the extraction of the Jew&#8217;s teeth to make
him pay the royal exaction, there would be no concurrence as to the
first word and second, or second and third, and if he learned the
Correlation it would be by mere repetition without aid from Analysis. In
such a case he would make and memorise his own Correlation, perhaps
thus: <strong class="smcap">Magna Charta</strong> &hellip; magnify &hellip; diminish &hellip; <strong class="smcap">DwiNDLe</strong>. When a pupil
makes his own Correlations, every concurrence he uses is a <em>real</em>
concurrence to him, and so with his <abbr title="Inclusions">Ins.</abbr> and <abbr title="Exclusions">Exs.</abbr> This is a decisive
reason why the Pupil should merely look upon my Correlations as models,
but make and memorise his <em>own</em> Correlations in all cases, as being more
vivid to <em>him</em> and, therefore, more certainly remembered, as well as
more effectively strengthening the Memory in both its Stages.</p>

<p>8. Vivid <abbr title="Inclusions">Ins.</abbr> by <em>meaning</em> are better than <abbr title="Inclusions">Ins.</abbr> by <abbr title="Sight">S.</abbr> (the latter when
used, should be as perfect as possible). <strong class="smcap">Ear</strong> &hellip; <strong class="smcap">Eel</strong> makes a weak <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by
<abbr title="Sight">S.</abbr> to some persons, but it would make a much more vivid first impression
to most persons to deal with them in this way: <strong class="smcap">Ear</strong> &hellip; (w)ring &hellip; twist
&hellip; wriggle &hellip; <strong class="smcap">Eel</strong>. But &ldquo;Bivou<i>ac</i> &hellip; <i>aq</i>ueduct&rdquo; is a perfect <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by
<abbr title="Sight">S.</abbr> as to the last syllable of the former and the first syllable of the
latter, since those syllables are pronounced exactly alike. We may
connect Bivouac to Rain thus: &ldquo;<em>Bivouac</em> &hellip; aqueduct &hellip; flowing water
&hellip; falling water &hellip; <strong class="smcap">Rain</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>9. <em>Never</em>&mdash;in the early stages of the study of the System&mdash;make a
<em>second</em> Correlation until you have <em>memorised the first</em>.</p>

<p>10. Although <em>making</em> and <em>memorising</em> Correlations serves the useful
purpose of fixing specific facts in the memory, yet the <strong class="smcap">main object</strong> in
making and memorising Correlations is to develop the latent power of the
Natural Memory to such a degree that all facts are hereafter remembered
without the aid of conscious Correlations.</p>

<p>11. Never try to find <em>analytic</em> date or number words until you <em>know
the material facts connected with the date or number</em> before you. The
student wishes to fix the date of<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;122">&zwnj;</span><a name="p122" id="p122"></a> Voltaire&#8217;s birth, in 1694. &ldquo;The
Shaper&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Giber&rdquo; occur to him. If he is ignorant of the facts of
Voltaire&#8217;s life, he will correlate thus: &ldquo;<i>Vol</i>taire &hellip; (1) &hellip;
volatile &hellip; (2) &hellip; &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; &hellip; (1) &hellip; &lsquo;The Shaper&rsquo; <i>Th</i>e <i>Sh</i>a<i>p</i>e<i>r</i>
(1694);&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vol<i>taire</i> &hellip; (1) &hellip; tear to pieces &hellip; (1) &hellip; mocking
dissector &hellip; (1) &hellip; <i>Th</i>e <i>G</i>i<i>b</i>e<i>r</i> (1694).&rdquo; If he had known that
Voltaire was a born writer, he would have found the analytic relation in
&ldquo;Voltaire &hellip; <i>Th</i>e <i>Sh</i>a<i>p</i>e<i>r</i> (1694)&rdquo; or if he had known that he was
a terrible mocker, he would have said: &ldquo;Voltaire &hellip; <i>Th</i>e <i>G</i>i<i>b</i>e<i>r</i>
(1694).&rdquo; If he wished to fix the date of the discovery of America, he
might think of &ldquo;<i>T</i>e<i>r</i>ra<i>p</i>i<i>n</i>&rdquo; (a large tide-water turtle, abounding
in Maryland), and correlate thus: &ldquo;Discovery of America &hellip; (1) &hellip;
Maryland &hellip; (3) &hellip; <i>T</i>e<i>r</i>ra<i>p</i>i<i>n</i> (1492).&rdquo; But if he remembers that
<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> covers all cases of Cause and Effect, Instrument or Means to End,
Person by whom, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and if he reflects that this discovery has been a
blessing to the Old as well as the New World, he would say: &ldquo;Discovery
of America &hellip; (3) <i>Tr</i>ue <i>B</i>oo<i>n</i> (1492).&rdquo; Or, if he considers that the
moment America was made known to Europe the whole of the Western
Continent was open to every new-comer, he would find analytic date-words
thus: &ldquo;Discovery of America &hellip; (3) &hellip; <i>D</i>oo<i>r</i> o<i>p</i>e<i>n</i> (1492).&rdquo; If he
merely wants to fix the fraction 92, he could use the first two
consonants of the name of one of his ships, and say: &ldquo;Discovery of
America &hellip; <i>P</i>i<i>n</i>ta (1492).&rdquo;</p>


<h3>ISOLATED FACTS.</h3>

<p>Correlate an <em>Isolated Fact</em> to something (to some fact in its
environment or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</i> that is <strong class="smcap">best known</strong> and) which you are sure to
<strong class="smcap">think of</strong> when you wish to recall the Isolated Fact.</p>


<h4>HOW TO REMEMBER PROPER NAMES WHEN INTRODUCED.</h4>

<p>An infallible method of remembering proper names is (1) Get the name
when introduced. If not quite sure, ask for it. (2) <em>Pronounce</em> the
<em>name aloud</em> whilst <em>looking at</em> the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;123">&zwnj;</span><a name="p123" id="p123"></a> person. Do this several times, if
possible. The object is to produce a concurrence or connection between
the <em>sight-image of the Person</em> and a <em>sound-image of his Name</em>. (3) To
help the ear for sound, always pronounce everyone&#8217;s name aloud whenever
you meet him. This helps nature. These directions carried out never fail
to make a pupil perfect in remembering proper names.</p>

<p>To remember <strong class="smcap">proper names</strong> in the absence of the person, correlate the
Person&#8217;s Name to the name of some Peculiarity of the Person (as the <strong class="smcap">best
known</strong> and) which you are sure to <strong class="smcap">think</strong> of whenever you think of the
Person. If you <em>memorise</em> the Correlation, you will recall the Name
whenever you think of this Peculiarity (whatever struck you about him).</p>

<p>To remember a proper name, Mnemonists resort to <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, by <abbr title="Sight">S.</abbr> But this
<em>alone</em> gives no starting point, no &ldquo;Best Known&rdquo; which you are certain
to think of, and which will enable you to recall the name, <em>provided</em>
you cement by a memorised Correlation the &ldquo;Best Known&rdquo; to the name
itself; in fact, a similarity of sound <em>alone</em> and <em>by itself</em> is likely
to mislead you into reviving itself instead of the name. A celebrated
Member of Parliament (who in the days of his youth, before he had
greatly tested Mnemonics, gave a high opinion of its value) was to
deliver an address at the Birkbeck Institution, some years ago. Having
difficulty in remembering proper names, he thought he would <em>fix</em> the
name of its founder in his memory by the Mnemonical device of finding a
word that sounded like it; he said to himself, &ldquo;It reminds me of
&lsquo;Pinchbeck.&rsquo;&rdquo; He commenced as follows: &ldquo;Before coming to the subject on
which I am to speak this evening, I desire to pay a deserved tribute of
praise to the founder of this great Institution, the celebrated Mr.
<strong class="smcap">Pinchbeck</strong>.&rdquo; A shout of laughter revealed to him that Mnemonics may get
us into trouble, and fail to help us out: he could not remember the
real name, Birkbeck, until it was told him. If he had mastered this
System, his <strong class="smcap">new</strong> memory-power would have enabled<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;124">&zwnj;</span><a name="p124" id="p124"></a> him to remember the true
name <em>without any device</em>; or, if he was but a beginner at my System he
could have remembered the name Birkbeck&mdash;which he was afraid he would
forget&mdash;by correlating it to the word&mdash;&ldquo;Founder,&rdquo; which he did remember,
thus:&mdash;<strong class="smcap">Founder</strong> &hellip; lost way &hellip; hark-back &hellip; Birkbeck; or, <strong class="smcap">Founder</strong> &hellip;
foundered horse &hellip; chestnut horse &hellip; chestnut &hellip; bur &hellip; <strong class="smcap">Birkbeck</strong>. If
he had memorised either of these Correlations, or one of his own, by
repeating the intermediates forwards and backwards two or three times,
and then recalled the two extremes, &ldquo;Founder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Birkbeck,&rdquo; several
times, the moment he thought of Founder, he would instantly have
recalled Birkbeck, one extreme recalling the other without the
intermediates being recalled. When one has received only a third of the
benefit of this System as a Memory-<strong class="smcap">trainer</strong>, the mere <em>making</em> of a
Correlation ensures remembering two extremes together without thinking
of intermediates.</p>

<p>[Dr. Johnson, when introduced to a stranger repeated his name several
times aloud and sometimes <em>spelled</em> it. This produced a vivid first
impression of the man&#8217;s <em>name</em>; but it did not <em>connect</em> the name to the
man who bore it. People who have adopted the Johnsonian Method
sometimes remember the name but apply it to the wrong person, because
they did not establish any relation between the name and the man to whom
it belonged.]</p>


<h4>EXERCISES IN CORRELATING.</h4>

<p>Make 20 of your own Correlations between faces and names (or between
words and meanings), using some of the extremes given by me, and, as
other extremes (words, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;125">&zwnj;</span><a name="p125" id="p125"></a> of your own selection, or) names and faces

<li>As Max <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">M&uuml;ller</span> names mental acts in this order: Sensation, Perception,
Conception, Naming, and Memory, would he hold that failure to remember
names implies weakness of naming power? No! Remembering a name is an act
wholly unlike imposing a name in the first instance. Such failure arises
from weakness of the auditory function, or of the perception of
individual peculiarities or failure of the sight-image to become
cemented to the sound image.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>A CONTRAST.</strong>&mdash;When unconnected ideas have to be united in the memory so
that hereafter one will recall the other, the teachers of other Memory
Systems say: &ldquo;What can I invent to tie them together&mdash;what story can I
contrive&mdash;what foreign extraneous matter can I introduce&mdash;what mental
picture can I imagine, no matter how unnatural or false the
juxtaposition may be, or what argument or comparison can I originate&mdash;no
matter how far-fetched and fanciful it may be, to help hold these
&lsquo;Extremes&rsquo; together?&rdquo; They do not reflect that all these mnemonical
outside and imported schemes must <em>also</em> be remembered, and that being
in the form of sentences expressing loose relation of mere physical
juxtapositions or the complex relations invented by constructive
imagination or subtle intellect, they are, to most, more difficult to
recollect than the extremes would be without these ponderous aids.
Hence, in their professed attempt to aid the memory, they really impose
a <em>new</em> and <em>additional burden</em> upon it.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Are you required to make any original correlations?</li>
<li>How many?</li>
<li>Between what extremes?</li>
<li>Do you find it difficult?</li>
<li>Have you any evidence given here that others have experienced any
difficulty in making them?</li>
<li>Did they finally succeed?</li>
<li>What question is frequently asked by other memory teachers?</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, I simply ask the memory what it <em>already knows</em> about
the &ldquo;Extremes.&rdquo; The first intermediate of a correlation is <em>directly</em>
connected through <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, with the first &ldquo;Extreme,&rdquo; and the
last intermediate with the last &ldquo;Extreme,&rdquo; and the intervening
intermediate (if there be one) with the other two, and thus, the
<em>intermediates being already in the memory</em>, and not the result of
invention or ingenuity, my Method of Correlation is purely<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;126">&zwnj;</span><a name="p126" id="p126"></a> and solely a
<strong class="smcap">Memory</strong> process. In this way, I use the <strong class="smcap">Memory to help the Memory</strong>, I use
the <em>reviving</em> power of the memory to make a vivid <strong class="smcap">First Impression</strong>
between two hitherto unconnected &ldquo;Extremes.&rdquo; I add nothing to the
&ldquo;Extremes,&rdquo; import nothing from abroad in regard to them, invent
nothing. I simply <em>arouse</em>, <em>re-waken</em> to consciousness, <em>what is
already stored away</em> in the memory in regard to those &ldquo;Extremes,&rdquo; and,
by reciting the Correlation a few times forwards and backwards, cement
the &ldquo;Extremes&rdquo; themselves so vividly together, that henceforth one
&ldquo;Extreme&rdquo; revives the other &ldquo;Extreme&rdquo; without the recall of the
intermediates.</p>

<p>And in the chapter on Recollective Analysis, and also in the previous
part of this chapter, I have given the attentive student such a
familiarity with the Memory Laws of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, that he can make
Correlations as easily as he breathes.</p>

<p>When learning prose or poetry by means of endless repetitions to
acquire, and endless views to retain, the mind soon wanders, and thus
discontinuity is promoted; but, in reciting a Correlation forwards <em>and
backwards</em> from memory, the mind cannot wander, and thus the continuity
is greatly strengthened. Again, memory is improved by exercise, and
<em>improved in the highest degree</em> by <em>making</em> and <em>memorising</em>
correlations, because in <em>making</em> them the <em>reviving</em> power of the
memory is exercised in conformity to Memory&#8217;s own laws; and in
<em>memorising</em> the Correlations both stages of memory are most vividly
impressed. Thus, making and memorising the Correlations TRAINS both
Memory and Continuity. And if to this training process there be added
the habit of Assimilation which the use of the Analytic-Synthetic and
Interrogative Analysis Methods of learning Prose and Poetry by heart
imparts, as well as my other training methods, then the NEW memory thus
acquired <em>will not demand the further use of the System any more than
the adult swimmer will need the plank by which as a boy he learned to
swim</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;127">&zwnj;</span><a name="p127" id="p127"></a>LEARNING FOREIGN WORDS.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The Guide to Memory, or a New and Complete Treatise of Analogy between
the French and English Languages,&rdquo; compiled by Charles Turrell,
Professor of Languages, and published in 1828, contains the words which
are the <em>same</em> in each language (alphabet, banquet, couplet, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>), and
those almost the same&mdash;&ldquo;Letters necessary in English, and superfluous in
French, are included in a parenthesis, thus Bag(g)age. Letters necessary
in French, and superfluous in English are printed in Italics, thus
Hom<i>m</i>age.&rdquo; At first sight it seems as if this plan were a good one (and
some still recommend it<a name="Anchor-J" id="Anchor-J"></a><a href="#Footnote-J" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote J."><span> Footnote </span>[J]</a>). But of the words which are the same in both
languages, some of them have meanings one rarely if ever needs to
express, while others are seldom seen except in Dictionaries, so the
student who uses this method does not make much <em>useful</em> progress. The
Rev. W. Healy, of Johnstown (Kilkenny), long before he had finished my
course of lessons, stated: &ldquo;<em>I wrote out the French words that
correspond to the English of everything around us and that are in common
use, and found that by the aid of <abbr title="Recollective Synthesis">Rec. Syn.</abbr> I could commit them much
faster than the time taken to write them out.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words he had made himself familiar with were those most frequently
met with in reading, and useful in speaking and writing.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Nasmith employed a clerk in finding the number of occurrences of
the same word in three books. Some words occurred thousands of times,
and others only five, or fewer. The words which frequently occurred he
arranged<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;128">&zwnj;</span><a name="p128" id="p128"></a> in order, the commonest first, and compiled exercises to suit
them. His &ldquo;Linguists&rdquo; (German and French) are published by Mr. D. Nutt,
of 270, Strand, London, and by the aid of them, and of my System, a
useful knowledge of German (or French) can be rapidly acquired.</p>

<p>A pupil who had a very slight acquaintance with French learned an
Analytic Series of French words, asking a French friend the meaning and
pronunciation of the words unfamiliar to him. By doing this he in about
an hour learned the spelling, pronunciation, and meaning of nearly 100
French words. Since then he has been extending the exercise, and in that
way he has learned 1,000 French words. In doing so he is strengthening
his memory by exercising it in accordance with its own laws, increasing
the control his will has over his attention, and extending his French
vocabulary.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Do we ever see words spelt differently but with the same pronunciation?</li>
<li>Is the use of the Dictionary required?</li>
<li>What examples have we here of the benefits derived from <abbr title="Recollective">Rec.</abbr>-Synthesis?</li>
<li>With what words did he make himself familiar?</li>
<li>Does the same word frequently occur in a book?</li>
<li>What proof can you mention?</li>
<li>What task was accomplished in about one hour by one of my pupils?</li>

</ol>

<p>To remember <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original read &lsquo;Unfamilar&lsquo;.">Unfamiliar</ins> English Words or <strong class="smcap">foreign words</strong>, correlate the
Definition as the <strong class="smcap">best known</strong> to the Unfamiliar or Foreign Word, and
memorise the Correlation. In the case of Foreign Words, the last
Intermediate is necessarily a case of Inclusion by sound. Sometimes
there is <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by sight or by sound between a part or the whole of the
English word, and a part or the whole of its Foreign equivalent, as
<i>Ap</i>ple&mdash;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>ap</i>fel</span> [German]. Of course, the pupil will not need the aid of
a correlation in such cases if he notice the analytic relation. The
French word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anachor&egrave;te</i> might have for its equivalent by sound either
&ldquo;<em>Anna</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Core</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Ate</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Anna goes late</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Ann a
core ate</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Anna&#8217;s cold hate</em>,&rdquo; and perhaps to some of my readers
it would seem like something else. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cravache</i> might sound like &ldquo;<em>Crack
of lash</em>.&rdquo; Pupils often disagree as to what is good Inclusion by sound;
let each use what suits himself, and not trouble about other people&#8217;s
ears. <em><abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by sound, or by sense, or by spelling</em>, is sufficient even if
it refers to <em>only one syllable</em>.</p>

<h3>HOW TO MEMORISE DATES, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, WHERE YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE FACTS, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></h3>

<p>Let every Pupil write examples of his own selection of names Correlated
to Dates of birth and death worked out<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;134">&zwnj;</span><a name="p134" id="p134"></a> as below, or some other <em>pairs</em>
of extremes, such as name of ship to its captain on one side, and its
tonnage (or destined port) on the other.</p>

<p>To remember <em>Dates</em> of <em>Birth</em> and <em>Death</em> (<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) of men, correlate the
<strong class="smcap">surname as best known</strong> to the word expressing the date of <strong class="smcap">birth</strong>, and
correlate the <strong class="smcap">birth-word</strong> to the <strong class="smcap">death</strong> [<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>] word:&mdash;</p>

<p>Do not look for Analytic Date-words in the following cases until you
have first memorised my Correlations or your own. You can then review
the examples and easily find Analytic Date-words if you are
<em>sufficiently acquainted</em> with the facts of the cases, as: Lord
Beaconsfield (18)05, <i>S</i>a<i>l</i>ient.<a name="Anchor-L" id="Anchor-L"></a><a href="#Footnote-L" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote L."><span> Footnote </span>[L]</a> Here is a supposed Analytic formula

<h3 class="smcap">Serial Facts.</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of Serial Facts.</p>

<p>(1) One is where names or facts are stated in a certain order, as in
alphabetical order, for instance, and yet a different order could be
given. Lists of exceptions in Grammar are usually stated in the
alphabetical order, yet if the component parts or words of the list are
remembered, the alphabetical order is of no consequence. One teacher has
re-arranged Series in Foreign Grammars in such a manner that he finds a
natural suggestiveness between the words. No doubt such a re-arrangement
can be made, but I question whether his doing it for another would help
the latter much. For the pupil to benefit, he should re-adjust the
Series for himself. My Pupils, when trained in Analysis and Synthesis,
have no difficulty in correlating the Series just as they may find it.
No time is spent in trying to discover relations that may not exist.<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;137">&zwnj;</span><a name="p137" id="p137"></a> At
best, when found, they will be weak; but, by correlating the series
together, my Pupils make a strong and vivid relation between all of the
words of a Series to be memorised, and at the same time exercise
attention in both its functions, and increase appreciation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>,
and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>How many kinds of Serial facts are there?</li>
<li>What are the characteristics of the first kind?</li>
<li>Is it advisable for the pupil to re-adjust Series in Foreign Grammars?</li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose we wish to memorise the 11 prepositions which form part of
certain Latin verbs which are followed by the dative, to wit:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad.</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ante.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Con.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ob.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pre.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro.</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sub.</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Super</i>. This Series is usually learned by <em>endless
repetition</em>, as a succession of sounds to the ear, or sight to the eye,
by mere <em>rote</em>. What a waste of time to attempt to re-arrange it in
order to learn it more easily. Yet such a Series can be learned by
correlating the words together in a very short time, thus:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad</i>    addition &hellip; front addition &hellip; <em>ante</em>-room&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ante</i>  antecedent &hellip; <i>con</i>sequent&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Con</i>   converse &hellip; <i>in</i>verse&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In</i></li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inter</i> interject &hellip; <i>ob</i>ject&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ob</i>    obligation &hellip; <i>post</i>poned obligation&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post</i>  post-office &hellip; <i>pre</i>payments&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pre</i>   predilection &hellip; <i>pro</i>pensity&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro</i>   produce &hellip; soil products &hellip; <i>sub</i>soil&hellip;.</li>
<li><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sub</i>   subordinate actor &hellip; <em>Super</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, similarly, we can deal with any Series in <strong>Grammar</strong>, or elsewhere.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Do my pupils ever find any difficulty in correlating the
series as they may find it?</li>
<li>What training must they have in order to do so?</li>
<li>Is any time misspent in trying to discover a non-existing relation?</li>
<li>What are the eleven Latin prepositions here given?</li>
<li>How are they usually learned?</li>
<li>Is time gained thereby?</li>
</ol>

<p>(2) The other kind of Series is where the words, facts, or things <em>must</em>
be memorised as given. The seven primary colours are given as they occur
in nature, thus:&mdash;Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red. The
unconscionable word VIBGYOR has been given as a means, through the
initial letters of the colour words, to enable us to remember those
words, and ROYGBIV to enable us to remember the Series backwards. To
such a pass are educators driven when they lack my Universal Method of
cementing Extremes. We know the Series both ways if we Correlate the
words, thus:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;138">&zwnj;</span><a name="p138" id="p138"></a><em>Violet</em> &hellip; let go</li>
<li><em>Indigo</em> &hellip; indigestion &hellip; &ldquo;blues&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Blue</em> &hellip; blue sea &hellip; sea green</li>
<li><em>Green</em> &hellip; green corn &hellip; ripe corn</li>
<li><em>Yellow</em> &hellip; yellow fruit</li>
<li><em>Orange</em> &hellip; orangemen &hellip; fights &hellip; blood split &hellip; blood-red &hellip; <em>Red</em>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>ORDER OF THE ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS.</h4>

<p>The true Method of learning the Order and Dates of the English
Sovereigns, as of the American Presidents, or of any other list of
Rulers, is to deal with them only in the course of reading. When met
with in History, all the facts are before the reader, and, if he fails
to hold the <em>order of succession</em> clearly in mind in any case, he can
easily correlate the Names together. And if he fails to retain some of
the dates, he can readily make forgetfulness impossible by correlating
names to date-words&mdash;or, as the details of the reigns are known to him,
he can at once find analytic date-words. The reader wishes to infallibly
remember that the date of the beheading of Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr> was 1649. The
formula is &ldquo;Charles&nbsp;<abbr title="the 1st">I.</abbr>&mdash;<i>T</i>oo <i>sh</i>a<i>rp</i> (1649).&rdquo; If the reader&#8217;s
memory-training is imperfect, and he is ignorant of the facts, he had
better correlate. If his memory-education is complete, and the facts are
within his knowledge, he will need no aid, or he will use analytic
date-words as in above case (1) <i>Th</i>en (6) <i>Ch</i>arles (4) <i>r</i>ightly (9)
<i>b</i>eheaded. If he feels that he needs some advice to help him remember
the order of succession of the Kings, he can refresh his recollection by
turning back and reading the method already given.</p>


<h3>EXERCISE.&mdash;CASES IN EVERY-DAY LIFE.</h3>

<p>The student must exercise his judgment as to what is the <em>best known</em> to
which he will Correlate an <em>isolated fact</em>.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is taken from the <strong class="smcap">Era Almanack</strong>, 1882, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>&nbsp;36. The
actor, whose name was Taylor, could not remember the name assigned to
him in his part of the play. We shall see how Mnemonics helped him.</p>

<p><strong class="smcap">Association of Ideas.</strong>&mdash;Macready was once victimised in <em>Virginius</em>. The
Numitorius could not remember the<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;139">&zwnj;</span><a name="p139" id="p139"></a> name given him in the play. &ldquo;You will
remember it, sir,&rdquo; said the tragedian, carefully pronouncing it for him,
&ldquo;by the association of ideas. Think of Numbers&mdash;the Book of Numbers.&rdquo;
The Numitorius did think of it all day, and at night produced through
&ldquo;the association of ideas&rdquo; the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>Numitorius</cite>&mdash;&ldquo;Where is Virginia? Wherefore do you hold that maiden&#8217;s
hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>Claudius</cite>&mdash;&ldquo;Who asks the question?&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>Numitorius</cite>&mdash;&ldquo;I, her uncle&mdash;<strong class="smcap">Deuteronomy</strong>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actor should have correlated the word &ldquo;Numitorius,&rdquo; which he could
<em>not</em> remember, to the word &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; as the BEST KNOWN that preceded it,
which he could remember, or to his &ldquo;cue&rdquo; the word &ldquo;Question&rdquo; thus:</p>

<ul style="font-size:0.9em; padding-left:2.222em;">
<li>UNCLE [2] Nephew [1] You [1] You <em>knew</em>&mdash;NU-mitorius. <em>Or</em>,</li>

<li>UNCLE [2] Niece [1] Neat [1] Neat and New [1] <em>A new mitre o&#8217;er
us</em> [1] NU-mitorius. <em>Or</em>,</li>

<li>QUESTION [1] Wants to know [1] Know [1] Knew [1] <em>knew my story</em>
[1] NU-mitorius. <em>Or</em>,</li>

<li>QUESTION [1] Quest [1] Guessed [1] Knew [1] <em>Knew a mighty Tory</em>
[1] NU-mitorius.</li>
</ul>

<p>Had the actor memorised either of these Correlations, he would <em>not</em>
have forgotten Numitorius in his performance. In all similar cases mere
<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by sound, like the word &ldquo;Numbers&rdquo; which Macready proposed, and which
is really <em>not a genuine <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> by sound</em>, is of little service to a poor
memory. A Correlation would have been much better.</p>

<p>To any conceivable &ldquo;<em>Isolated Fact</em>&rdquo; you can find a <em>Best Known</em> to
which you can correlate it, and thereby always have it at command. This
is true, even in cases of <em>anticipatory</em> memory. Instead of tying a
string round your finger to remind you to buy something when you get to
the bazaar, and when you get there forgetting to notice the string or
forgetting what the string was intended to remind you of, correlate the
name of what you wish to purchase to the name of something you are sure
to <em>think</em> of at the place you are going to, and memorise the
Correlation. When you see the <em>Best Known</em>, the thing you correlated to
it will at once occur to mind. I will add only one more
illustration:&mdash;A commercial traveller was in the habit of putting his
watch under his pillow, and also in the habit of forgetting<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;140">&zwnj;</span><a name="p140" id="p140"></a> that he put
it there! After losing two watches in this way, he came to me to improve
his memory, and asked me if my System could aid him to think of his
watch and where he had put it. &ldquo;Infallibly,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;if there is
anything you can mention which you are <em>certain</em> to think of when you
get up, such as boots, trousers, hat, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>&rdquo; &ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; he
rejoined, &ldquo;I am more certain to think of than any article of clothing. I
always think what a shame it is I have to get up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you are sure
to think of the words &lsquo;get up;&rsquo; that then is your <em>Best Known</em>.
Correlate the word &lsquo;watch&rsquo; to it <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original had only 2 dots here. It is not clear what punctuation was intended.">&hellip;</ins> thus: &lsquo;GET UP&rsquo;&mdash;Spring
up&mdash;Watch Spring&mdash;WATCH.&rdquo; After a tour of four months he reported he had
always thought of his watch the moment he awoke.</p>


<h4>SPEAKING WITHOUT WRITTEN OR PRINTED NOTES.</h4>

<p>After the clergyman has decided on his text, or the speaker on any
subject he has selected for his special topic, the next step is to
<em>think it out</em>&mdash;to make his plan&mdash;his mode of development of his
ideas&mdash;their order and sequence, illustrations, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> All this will
constitute an outline&mdash;the SKELETON OF THE DISCOURSE. This should
usually be <em>committed to paper</em>. If he possesses the requisite command
of language to enable him to express his views, all he now requires to
do is to <em>thoroughly memorise</em> this Skeleton.</p>

<p>When this is done, the orator will have no occasion to have any notes
<em>before him to refer to</em>, and thereby to remind his audience that he is
merely rehearsing fervour a week or more old; but, having the exact
order of ideas in his memory, he can proceed to speak on each
<em>successive</em> topic until he has exhausted all the points and
illustrations that he had intended to use.</p>

<p>A young clergyman is very apt to imagine that he will correlate together
20 to 100 propositions in every discourse&mdash;a theoretical conjecture
never verified in fact. In <em>practice</em>, he will find that he will very
rarely correlate more than ten propositions together, and he will
correlate sub-propositions, citations, or illustrations to the
respective propositions<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;141">&zwnj;</span><a name="p141" id="p141"></a> to which they belong. Instead of correlations,
<em>he may unite his propositions together by analysis</em>. Each person will
manage this matter as he finds most convenient to himself; or, if he
desires to literally memorise his discourses, he can do so in the manner
pointed out in learning sentences, or by two or three careful perusals.
But, by one who speaks without notes is generally understood one who has
only memorised his leading ideas, and it is always a judicious practice
for a beginner to rehearse his leading topics and their amplifications
in private, <em>that he may test his memory</em>, and then <em>become familiar</em>
with a procedure <em>in private</em> in order to be sure to be <em>perfect in it
before the public</em>. This private discipline is all the more necessary in
the early stages of extempore speaking&mdash;if the speaker is at all
troubled by nervous anxieties or mind-wandering.</p>

<p>Suppose a teacher of the Art of Expression has studied Moses True
Brown&#8217;s [see his Synthetic Philosophy of Expression] reduction of
Delsarte&#8217;s Nine Laws of Gesture to Brown&#8217;s One Law of
Correspondence&mdash;and suppose this teacher wishes to explain to his class,
or to an audience, how Mr. Brown proceeded. If he desires to do this
without notes, he must memorise the order of those Nine Laws; they are
abstractly stated and difficult to correlate, but it can be done. The
Laws are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="small">
<li>Motion,</li>
<li>Velocity,</li>
<li>Direction or Extension,</li>
<li>Re-action,</li>
<li>Form,</li>
<li>Personality,</li>
<li>Opposition of Agents,</li>
<li>Priority, or Sequence,</li>
<li>Rhythm.</li>
</ul>

<p>The teacher must correlate these heads or topics of his discourse
together, and so memorise his correlations that he can recall the series
in the exact order. Perhaps he may proceed thus:</p>

<ul class="small">
<li><strong class="smcap">Motion.</strong></li>
<li class="indent">[Rate of motion.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Velocity.</strong></li>
<li class="indent">[Relation of motion to time and <em>space</em>&mdash;.]</li>
<li><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;142">&zwnj;</span><a name="p142" id="p142"></a><strong class="smcap">Direction</strong> or Extension.</li>
<li class="indent">[Direction reversed.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Re-action.</strong></li>
<li class="indent">[Mould of Action.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Form.</strong></li>
<li class="indent">[Form of the Human.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Personality.</strong></li>
<li class="indent">[Its extremes.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Opposition of Agents.</strong></li>
<li class="indent">[First opponent.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Priority</strong> or Sequence.</li>
<li class="indent">[Periodicity of Sequence.]</li>
<li><strong class="smcap">Rhythm.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing these Nine Laws in the above <em>order</em>, he can discuss them one
after the other. When he has finished his explanation of the reduction
of the three Forms of Motion [Concentric, Poise, and Eccentric] to the
Law of Correspondence, he can proceed to the consideration of the
sub-topics under Velocity, and so on. When he has fixed the other of his
topics in mind, he has a mental chart or map to guide him in his
exposition, and similarly in other cases.</p>

<p>To memorise the attachments of muscles, first of all familiarise
yourself by diligent dissection with the aspects of the muscles and the
actual facts of their attachments. It is possible to memorise their
origins and insertions by my System, merely from their written
descriptions; but this is not <em>learning</em>. It is a vicious system of
cramming, which can do no good. When you have thoroughly familiarised
yourself with the actual facts proceed to fix these facts<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;144">&zwnj;</span><a name="p144" id="p144"></a> in your memory
by my System. In dealing with facts of such complexity as the origin and
insertion of muscles, it may be needful to have free recourse to the
assistance of homophones, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In the whole of anatomy there is no task
so difficult as that of learning the precise attachments of the muscles
of the back. Few students master these attachments thoroughly, and those
who do, fail to retain them long.</p>

<ol class="sidenote">
<li>Are all students required to learn extracts from Quain&#8217;s Anatomy?</li>
<li>How many branches are there of the External Carotid Artery?</li>
<li>Describe them.</li>
<li>Is it an advantage in studying Anatomy to dissect or study a model?</li>
<li>How are the facts, then, easily learned?</li>
<li>Make original correlations for this Extract.</li>
<li>Do you use any unfamiliar words in your correlations?</li>
<li>How do you memorise the attachments of muscles?</li>
<li>Is it possible to memorise their origins and insertions by my System?</li>
<li>Is this <em>learning</em>?</li>
<li>What is it then?</li>
</ol>

<p>By the System it is easy to learn facts of Anatomy. But the System is no
substitute for <em>dissection and experiment</em>. You can get a <strong class="smcap">comprehension</strong>
of anatomical facts only by <em>actual experience</em>, and to attempt to
require an <em>understanding</em> of them from books is to substitute a
knowledge of words for a knowledge of things.</p>

<p>The following will indicate one way in which you may proceed in
memorising the attachments of the muscles of the back:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) First make a homophone of the name of the muscle.</li>

<li>(2) Indicate each attachment of the muscle by two words.

<p>The initial letter of the first word should indicate the part of
bone to which the muscle is attached, <em>e.g.</em>, Sp&nbsp;= spinous
process, T&nbsp;= transverse process, R&nbsp;= rib, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The second word
should indicate by its consonants the <em>numbers</em> of the bones
to which the attachment is made.</p></li>

<li>(3) Correlate the homophone of the muscle to the first pair of
words, and the first pair to the second pair. For example:</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;The <strong class="smcap">Splenius Colli</strong> is attached, inferiorly, to the spinous processes of
the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal vertebr&aelig;, and superiorly to
the transverse processes of the first two or three cervical vertebr&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">
spleniuS COLLi (homophone) SCOLD.<br />

gold statuette &hellip; chimney ornament &hellip; clock &hellip; &#8217;TIS TIME.<br />
</p>

<p>In the first pair of words the initial of Splendid shows<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;145">&zwnj;</span><a name="p145" id="p145"></a> that the
attachment is to the Spinous processes, and the word Image indicates
that the vertebr&aelig; implicated are the third to the sixth. The second pair
show that the transverse processes, from the first to the third, are
those into which the muscle is inserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <strong class="smcap">Splenius Capitis</strong> arises from the spines of the seventh cervical and
two upper dorsal vertebr&aelig; and from the ligamentum nuch&aelig;. It is inserted
into the lower and back part of the mastoid process, and into the outer
part of the superior curved line of the occipital bone.&rdquo;</p>

The medical student would doubtless first objectively identify these

<h2><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;149">&zwnj;</span><a name="p149" id="p149"></a><a name="BOOKS-LEARNED-IN-ONE-READING" id="BOOKS-LEARNED-IN-ONE-READING"></a>BOOKS LEARNED IN ONE READING.</h2>


<p>For the past ten years I have printed in my large prospectus a general
view of my meaning. I will reproduce most of those views here, premising
that I have never suggested that books are to be <em>learned by heart</em>, but
only the <em>important</em>, <em>useful</em> portions of them&mdash;such as are new to the
reader and which he may desire to retain.</p>

<p>I do not mean such books as Bradshaw&#8217;s Guide, the London Post-Office
Directory, or any other mere collection of names, addresses, statistics,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, which one may have occasion to <em>consult</em>, but which it would be the
mere bravado of Memory to learn by heart&mdash;though even this is possible
enough to the master of my System. What is one&#8217;s object in reading a
book? Simply to retain the IDEAS in it that are NEW and USEFUL to him,
as well as the NEW USES that are therein set forth of <em>old</em> and
<em>familiar</em> ideas. If the reader is already partly acquainted with a
book, there will be fewer new ideas in it than in one with which he is
unacquainted. Now, what do I mean by Learning either of these books in
one reading? I mean exactly what I say. All that you desire to remember
shall be retained&mdash;all the leading or subordinate ideas, propositions,
illustrations, facts, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>There are only two ways of learning a book in this thorough manner:</p>

<p>(1) <em>The first</em> is the traditional method of learning by <em>rote</em> or
endless repetition. A celebrated Coach in Anatomy says that no one can
learn Anatomy until he has learned and <em>forgotten</em> it from three to
seven times! In learning any book in this way, each sentence would be
repeated over and over again, and then reviewed and <i>re</i>learnt and
forgotten and learned again! And then at last the Pupil if he possesses
a first-rate <em>cramming</em> memory might answer questions on it. In
learning a book by <em>rote</em>, the number of times that each sentence and
section is repeated, if actually<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;150">&zwnj;</span><a name="p150" id="p150"></a> written out and printed, would
doubtless cover 5,000 to 50,000 or more pages!&mdash;and even then the Pupil
passes his examination, if he really does &ldquo;pass,&rdquo; partly by luck and
partly by merit; all his life he is constantly referring to it, and
repeating it, and studying it, over and over again&mdash;showing really that
he possesses little more than a Reference Memory in regard to it! But
let us be candid and confess the truth; tens of thousands every year and
during successive years try the various professions&mdash;law, medicine,
divinity, or sciences, history, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and utterly fail to &ldquo;pass,&rdquo;
even respectably, because they lack the extraordinary sensuous MEMORY
necessary to acquire knowledge by <em>rote</em>.</p>

<p>It is only the exceptionally powerful natural memories that win at
exacting examinations by <em>rote</em>&mdash;even then their learning is soon
forgotten, unless it is <em>perpetually renewed</em>.</p>

<p>(2) The other mode of learning any book in the thorough manner I have
indicated, whether it be a book in which the reader finds but <em>few</em>
novel ideas or where they are <em>all new</em>, as in a scientific or technical
work, is by my Method. In fact, I believe no one can learn any book so
thoroughly by <em>rote</em>, even if he possesses a marvellous Natural Memory
and if he peruse it ever so many times, as my Pupils can by my method in
a single perusal. Let the reader note that my System has two important
aspects&mdash;(1) It is a Device or Method of memorising or learning any
facts whatever&mdash;prose, poetry, dates, data, formul&aelig; and facts and
principles of the sciences, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, or anything whatsoever to be
remembered. (2) There is another equally, if not <em>more</em> important aspect
of it, namely, as a <em>Trainer or Strengthener of the Natural Memory</em> to
any extent the pupil wishes to carry it. And the Natural Memory is so
strengthened by the use of the System, that as a Device, the System is
no longer required. You then remember from your new Memory-power without
taking any pains to remember, and I am happy to add that the diligent
student can derive the full benefit of the System as a Memory Trainer by
learning the lessons in the way I point out.</p>

<p>Now, those who have thus derived the <em>full benefit</em> of the System, both
as a Device for memorising and also as a Memory Trainer, <i>are the
persons who can learn a book in one<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;151">&zwnj;</span><a name="p151" id="p151"></a> reading</i>. &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; is used by
Coaches in a technical sense; that is, synonymous with &ldquo;thorough study.&rdquo;
By a &ldquo;single&rdquo; or &ldquo;one reading,&rdquo; I mean a single careful perusal <em>in
conformity to the requirements of my System</em>. I do not mean that they
can do this and doze during the process.</p>

<p>I now reproduce most of the plan always adopted in dealing with books
whose contents, or the unfamiliar portions of them are to be mastered.</p>

<p>(1) You will not read the book with the <em>rapidity</em> with which some young
ladies are said to devour the latest novel. They are often suspected of
skipping pages at a time in order to discover the different stages of a
plot, until a thoroughly aroused curiosity compels them to hasten at
once to the last chapter to fall upon the denouement. This is not the
style of perusal I contemplate.</p>

<p>(2) Nor is it to be supposed because you understand the method that it
will therefore work itself. It has to be <em>applied</em> carefully and
methodically <em>at least once</em>. This necessarily demands <em>time</em>,
especially at first. Those who possess good health and good continuity,
and a mastery of the System, accomplish the retention of a work in
vastly less time than would be possible for them without the System, and
the study is a pleasure instead of a task. On the other hand, those who
are in the possession of poor health or of weak concentration, or who
are overburdened with business anxieties, domestic cares or competitive
worries, would very seldom, if ever, master any book in the ordinary way
by <em>mere repetition</em>. These persons are extremely unfavourably situated
to do justice to the System, and it costs them more time and trouble to
master a book than the former class. A student admitted that he had
carefully read a manual of English History completely through <em>sixteen</em>
times, and then failed in the examination. To have obtained a lasting
knowledge of this History by my method would probably have occupied him
as long as he was formerly engaged in <em>two or three</em> of the sixteen
fruitless perusals of it. There is, however, only one difference between
this unfortunate student and the great majority of those who succeed in
the examinations through <em>cramming</em>. He forgot all his historical
knowledge <em>before</em> the examination&mdash;they usually forget<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;152">&zwnj;</span><a name="p152" id="p152"></a> theirs shortly
<em>after</em>. In fact, a student or a man in advanced years who has really
mastered any book so that he never has to refer to it again is a wonder.
Take the memories of members of the learned professions&mdash;they are
usually only <strong class="smcap">reference</strong> memories. They know where to <em>find</em> the coveted
knowledge, but they do not <em>possess</em> it or <em>retain</em> it in their minds.
On the other hand, the student who masters a book by my method <em>really
knows</em> the contents of it, and he is thus enabled to devote to other
purposes <em>an enormous amount of time in the future</em> that other people
have to spend in <em>perpetually refreshing</em> their superficial
acquirements. Moreover, the average student who has carried out <em>all</em> my
instructions can even <em>now</em> learn as much by my Method in any stated
time as he could learn without my Method, and <em>with equal thoroughness</em>
in many, many times as long a period! And if any one who has been
pressed for time, or who has been in a panic about an impending
examination, or who has been too much troubled with Discontinuity, too
ill in general health, or too idle, to do more than superficially glance
at my lessons&mdash;if any such person doubts his competency to accomplish as
much as the diligent student of average ability has done, then let him
turn back and really and truly MASTER my System [for he does not even
<strong class="smcap">know</strong> what my System is until he has faithfully carried out to the very
letter all my instructions, unless he has been a pupil of my oral
lectures], and then and not before he will probably find that the
achievements of the average diligent student of my System are quite
within the easy range and scope of his own powers.</p>

<p>(3) In regard to the <em>subject matter</em> of the book, you do not care to
occupy yourself with what you are <em>already familiar</em> with, and in most
books there are a great many things that you already know. In many
works, too, there is a great deal of padding-matter inserted to increase
the bulk of the book, and possessing no permanent interest. The
expositions and explanations which enable you to <em>understand</em> the new
matter usually take up a large part of the book, and sometimes much the
largest part of it, and are not to be memorised, but only understood
with a sole view to appreciate the valuable and important parts<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;153">&zwnj;</span><a name="p153" id="p153"></a> of the
book&mdash;these expositions can be learned if desired&mdash;but they usually
serve only a preliminary purpose. There is also very much
<em>repetition</em>&mdash;the same matter in new dress, is reintroduced for sake of
additional comments or applications. You do not trouble yourself with
these iterations. The contents of a book which demand your attention are
the IDEAS which are NEW to you, or the NEW USES made of familiar ideas.</p>

<p>Students who have not learned to exercise any independent thought often
confess that in reading any book they are always in a maze. One thing
seems just as important as another. To them the wheat looks exactly like
the chaff. As an illustration that the power of Analysis is entirely
wanting in many cases, I may mention that I once received a letter in
which the writer had literally copied one of my column advertisements,
and then added, &ldquo;Please send me what relates to the above!&rdquo; A modicum of
mental training would have led him to say, &ldquo;Kindly send me your
Prospectus.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>LEARN FIRST TO MAKE ABSTRACTS OF WHAT IS NEW TO YOU.</h3>

<p>A great authority on education says: &ldquo;Any work that deserves thorough
study, deserves the labor of making an Abstract, <em>without which, indeed,
the study is not thorough</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A work which deserves thorough study is obviously one full of IDEAS, new
to the reader, such as the student must master.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of making an Abstract of a particular book, awaken
the utmost interest in regard to it before you begin. Are you sure that
it is worthy of thorough study? Is it the last or best work on the
subject? And if you advance, note in a separate memorandum book your
criticisms on the author&#8217;s method and the soundness of his views. These
criticisms will help keep up your interest in the Abstract, and at the
close enable you to suggest modifications, additions, excisions, or a
refutation.</p>

<p>Three things are required: (1) To learn <strong>how</strong> to abstract; (2) To <strong>make</strong>
one, at least, such abstract; and (3) To <strong>learn</strong> it when made.</p>


<h4><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;154">&zwnj;</span><a name="p154" id="p154"></a>HOW TO MAKE ABSTRACTS.</h4>

<p>Let the ambitious student make an Abstract of any chapter of John Stuart
Mill&#8217;s Logic, and then compare his work with the Analysis of this same
chapter by the Rev. A.&nbsp;H. Killick (published by Longmans), and he will
at once see the enormous difference between the essentials and the
non-essentials&mdash;the difference between the subject of discussion and the
<em>explanation</em> or <em>exposition</em> of it. The student&#8217;s abstract, if printed,
would extend over twenty to thirty pages. Mr. Killick&#8217;s only occupies
two to five pages. But do not reverse the process and read Mr. Killick&#8217;s
Analysis first and then make your Abstract. The latter, however, is <em>the
easier</em>, <em>the usual</em>, and <em>the useless</em> method. Let the student continue
this comparison till he attains very nearly the brevity and
discrimination displayed by Mr. Killick. Or, if he prefers History, let
him write a summary of any chapter of Green&#8217;s &ldquo;Short History of the
English People,&rdquo; and then compare his digest with Mr. C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;A. Tait&#8217;s
Analysis of the same chapter (now bound up with Green&#8217;s History, as
lately published in England). It would be a capital training for the
student to abstract the whole of Green&#8217;s work and compare his abridgment
of each chapter with that of Mr. Tait. After considerable practice in
this way in making Abstracts and <em>comparing his work with that of such
Masterly Abstractors</em> as Dr. Killick and Mr. Tait, the student who needs
this training is prepared to make abstracts of his own text-books.</p>

<p>Any other work of which an Abstract is published will serve the student
as well as the above. There were formerly published Abstracts of several
law books. And there may be other works whose abstracts are available to
the ambitious student.</p>

<p>Abstracts would be very amusing if they did not indicate<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;155">&zwnj;</span><a name="p155" id="p155"></a> an almost total
failure of educational training in the matter of <em>thinking for one&#8217;s
self</em>. Recently a Pupil brought me a work on Physiology, written for
general readers, and pointing to a paragraph in it that occupied nearly
a whole page, exclaimed, &ldquo;The only way I can make an abstract of that
paragraph is to <em>learn it by heart</em>!&rdquo; A glance at it showed me that I
could express the gist and pith of it in the following sentence:&mdash;&ldquo;The
pulse beats 81&nbsp;times per minute when you are standing, 71&nbsp;times when
sitting, and 66&nbsp;times when lying down.&rdquo; After a re-perusal of the
paragraph he remarked, &ldquo;You are right. That is all one cares to remember
in that long passage.&rdquo; To his request for me to memorise the Abstract, I
replied by asking what is the &ldquo;Best Known&rdquo; in it. Why, &ldquo;pulse,&rdquo; of
course. It is merely occupied with the <em>number of times</em> the pulse beats
per minute in different positions of the body. Now correlate (memorising
your correlations as you proceed) &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; to &ldquo;standing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;standing&rdquo;
to a word expressing 81 (<i>f</i>ee<i>t</i>); &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; to a word that translates
71 (<i>c</i>augh<i>t</i>); and &ldquo;lying down&rdquo; to a word that spells in figures 66
(<i>j</i>ud<i>g</i>e). The bodily positions being exhaustively enumerated need not
be correlated together. Pulse &hellip; beating &hellip; fighting &hellip; stand-up
fight &hellip; STANDING &hellip; stand &hellip; small table &hellip; table legs &hellip; FEET.
SITTING &hellip; rest &hellip; arrest &hellip; CAUGHT. LYING DOWN &hellip; lies &hellip; perjury
&hellip; trial &hellip; JUDGE.</p>

<p>These efforts in abstracting will qualify the young student to
distinguish the main ideas from the subordinate ones, and he will then
know when reading a book what to attend to and what to reject. Try a
short essay first, then a longer one; and at last, when you are familiar
with the method, attack any book, and you will cope with it
successfully. Not much practice in this way will be required to enable
you to know, from a glance at the <em>table of contents</em>, just what to
assail and what to disregard. And in all your <em>first</em> attempts in
reading a technical work, make out an Abstract of each chapter in
writing, and then deal only with this Abstract. Whenever the Subject is
not treated in a desultory manner, but with logical precision, you will
soon be able to find Suggestive or Prompting Words in the Sequence of
Ideas and in the successive Links in the Chain<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;156">&zwnj;</span><a name="p156" id="p156"></a> of Thought that runs
through the exposition. If there is no such Sequence of Ideas or Chain
of Thought running through it, it may serve as an amusement, but is
little likely to command serious study. <em>In a short time</em> you will be
able, in the language of Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;to tear out the heart of any
book.&rdquo; Hazlitt said that Coleridge rarely read a book through, &ldquo;but
would plunge into the marrow of a new volume and feed on all the
nutritious matter with surprising rapidity, grasping the thought of the
author and following out his reasonings to consequences of which he
never dreamt.&rdquo; Such a result is rarely attained even by the ablest of
men&mdash;but it is the ultimate goal at which every student should aim&mdash;an
aim in which he will be largely assisted by the ART OF ASSIMILATIVE
MEMORY.</p>

<p>There are four methods of learning abstracts: one is by Synthesis; the
other is by the Analytic-Synthetic Method, the third is mostly by
Assimilative Analysis, and the fourth method is by the memory developed
and trained by the System, but which is not consciously used.</p>

<p>(1) It is the novelties of Fact, Opinion, Illustration, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, set forth
in your Abstract that you correlate together, thus: You correlate the
Title of the First Chapter to the Title of the Book; next, the Titles of
the Chapters to each other; and then you correlate, in each chapter, the
first leading idea or proposition to the title of the chapter, the
second leading idea to the first, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In this way you will proceed
until you have absorbed all the <em>new ideas</em>, <em>facts</em>, <em>statistics</em> or
<em>illustrations</em>, or whatever you wish to retain. You can then test
yourself on the work by calling to mind whatever you have thus cemented
together. If this is well done you will never have to do it again.</p>

<p>(2) We have already seen how to apply the Analytic-Synthetic Method in
learning by heart selections in Prose or Poetry, and same method can be
used in memorising an Abstract of such parts of a book as are new to the
reader. This method, too, once used in addition to what has been done by
the pupil, will make a further resort to it unnecessary.</p>

<p>(3) And the same remark applies to the third method.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth method is the pupil&#8217;s final method.</p>

<p><span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;157">&zwnj;</span><a name="p157" id="p157"></a>The foregoing exhaustive methods of dealing with a book are recommended
to those only whose natural memories are not yet made powerfully
retentive by the System as a Memory-TRAINER. If, however, a Pupil
possesses a good natural memory and a mastery of the System as a Device
for memorising, and he has also greatly added to the power of his
Concentration as well as his memory by doing all the exercises, he <em>will
not use my System, even in the reading of the first book, except now and
then</em>&mdash;certainly <em>not</em> constantly, but <em>only occasionally</em>. Although not
necessary in case of memories made strong by the System, yet I do most
earnestly recommend the most gifted and highly endowed to deal with
<em>one</em> book in the above thorough-going manner. As for instance, Herbert
Spencer&#8217;s little work on Education [four short essays]. Dr. Charles
Mercier, who next to Herbert Spencer is the most original and clear
sighted Psychologist in England, presents, in a work entitled &ldquo;Sanity
and Insanity,&rdquo; a scarcely equalled example of lucid exposition and
logical development. Whichever one is selected it should be fairly and
honestly handled by my method. The gain to Intellectual Comprehension
from having carefully abstracted one book, and the gain to the memory
from having made and memorised the Abstract, will produce results that
will last through life, and make all subsequent acquisitions more easy
and delightful, and make all further abstracts probably unnecessary. <a class="toclink" rel="contents" title="Contents." href="#CONTENTS">&larr;ToC</a></p>



<hr />
<h2 class="smcap"><a name="One_Hundred_Events_of_the_Victorian_Era" id="One_Hundred_Events_of_the_Victorian_Era"></a>How to learn a long series of Unconnected Facts in the Sciences or
Events in History, Chapters in Books, or the Contents of Books.</h2>

<p>1. It is useless for the pupil to attempt to learn the exercise here
given unless he has carefully studied the <a href="#THE-BRAIN-TONIC-EFFECT">Building</a>, <a href="#ice">Ice</a>, <a href="#HOW-TO-LEARN-PROPER-NAMES">Presidential</a>,
and <a href="#ENGLISH-SOVEREIGNS">English Sovereign</a> Series. The <em>meaning</em> of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> can be
understood in application to the facts of life, the events of History
and the principles and details of the Arts and Sciences, only by a
complete mastery of all that precedes this exercise.</p>

<p>2. Let the pupil learn only <em>ten</em> facts, propositions or statements at
each of the first few sittings, and then, as he<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;158">&zwnj;</span><a name="p158" id="p158"></a> adds ten more, let him
recite from memory all that he has previously learned of this exercise.
The <em>cementing relations</em> of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, and <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>, which bind the events
together, must in each case be first found by the student himself, and
afterwards, and not before, let him glance at my analysis which follows
this series.</p>

<p>3. The lawyer, in selecting 100 or 1,000 events of the Victorian Era,
would doubtless make a list interesting to lawyers, the physician would
make one of interest mostly or mainly to doctors, and similarly with
educators, statesmen, editors, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> But I have selected events with
a view to find the most difficult cases to deal with and with no other
view, and if the pupil masters these, all other work hereafter will be
easy to him.</p>

<p>4. This method can be promptly used, provided the pupil does not attempt
to engorge or cloy his mind by undertaking too much at a time at first.
Practice will soon make longer exercises easy. Each of the following six
Exercises is enough for any one session or sitting.</p>

<p>5. Between a pair of <em>words</em> it may be difficult sometimes to find
either the relation of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr>; but in the case of sentences,
propositions or descriptions, it is always easy to find one or other of
the cementing relations. Relations which to me are strong, may seem weak
to some pupils. No two persons would find the same relation in some
cases, but, however different the solutions may be, they must always
verify <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr>, <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr>, or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr></p>

<p>6. The <abbr title="Interrogative">Int.</abbr> Analysis, the Analytic-Synthetic, or the mere Analytic
method, will enable the pupil to memorise the statement or sentence
which describes the fact whenever any aid is necessary.</p>

<p>7. This Method can be readily applied to events in ancient or modern
times, or to an accumulation of facts in the sciences, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>8. If we were to express only the year the formula would in most cases
be different. To indicate the month and the day of the month, a
consistent phrase must be used.</p>

<h3>ANALYSIS OF ONE HUNDRED EVENTS OF THE VICTORIAN ERA.</h3>

<ul class="hang">
<li><strong>1 and 2&mdash;<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> and <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;The Victorian Era began June 20, 1837, and
an Act for the abolition of the death penalty for forgery,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, was passed nearly a month later. Here is the relation of
Sequence or <abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> The main motive for enacting the law was<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;163">&zwnj;</span><a name="p163" id="p163"></a>
doubtless sympathy. Death appeared to be too cruel for the
crime; hence the <em>sympathy</em> on the part of the Sovereign, the
founder of the Era, and of the legislators brought the Act
into existence. Here we have the relation of Simple Inclusion.</li>

<li><strong>2 and 3&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Criminals try to live by their wits, without work.
The trade unionists live by labour. The modes of livelihood of
these two classes are opposed. Hence it is <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>3 and 4&mdash;<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> and <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Trades union people and navigators are
laborers.&mdash;Here is <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> But the former work mostly at home or
in their own country, and the sailors are engaged beyond the
boundaries of their native country.&mdash;Here is <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> from
difference of locality.</li>

<li><strong>4 and 5&mdash;<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;The sailors on the Great Western worked beyond the
limits of their native country, and an International Copyright
Law extends its influence even into the area of foreign lands.
In the view of the sphere of operation these two cases contain
an element in common.&mdash;Hence it is <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>5 and 6&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;The International Copyright Law was enacted after
long and earnest agitation&mdash;but all legal.&mdash;The Chartist
agitators had to be suppressed. Here are conditions opposed to
each other.&mdash;It is <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>6 and 7&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;The Chartist agitation was extreme, and was
proclaimed illegal. The Anti-Corn Law League acted prudently
and within the law. Here again are opposed conditions. It is
<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>7 and 8&mdash;<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;The Anti-Corn Law League was organised to help give
cheap food to the masses. The Penny Postage Act was enacted to
help the poor man, to save expense. A similar aim prompted the
supporters of both measures.&mdash;It is <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>8 and 9&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Favouring the masses by cheap postage calls
attention to the majority or the great body of the people. The
marriage of the highest dignitaries of the State directs
attention to the most favoured or exalted personages in the
country. The extremes of the community are brought into
relation. It is <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>9 and 10&mdash;<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> and <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Parents and child is a Sequence. Hence
<abbr title="Concurrence">Con.</abbr> and a child possessing the blood of his parents sustains
the relation also of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> to them. Let the pupil pause here,
and before his next session of study of these events, let him
recite these ten backwards and forwards several times from
memory.</li>

<li><strong>10 and 11&mdash;<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Brother and sister possessing in common the blood
of their parents is a case of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>11 and 12&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Here is a birth contrasted with a death.&mdash;It is
<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>12 and 13&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Death on the one hand and on the other a
widespread effort to bring into existence Acts of Parliament.
Self-destruction contrasted with efforts at production.</li>

<li><strong>13 and 14&mdash;<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Here are two winners and two losers. The parties
opposed to Chartists defeat the hearing of this proposed
motion; and the British soldiers gain a victory over the
Boers. Success in common makes a case of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr> on the part of
the victorious<span class="num" title="Page&nbsp;164">&zwnj;</span><a name="p164" id="p164"></a> parties. And then the Chartists lost their
proposed hearing and the Boers were beaten. This is the second
<abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>14 and 15&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;A resort to arms contrasted with a resort to
diplomacy.</li>

<li><strong>15 and 16&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;A treaty between the two greatest nations of the
earth, and loss of 10,000 men. A triumph of Peace and a
triumph in War.</li>

<li><strong>16 and 17&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr></strong>&mdash;The death of a multitude of soldiers and a birth
in the highest family of the realm.</li>

<li><strong>17 and 18&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> and <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;A birth and a death gives <abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> A <em>royal</em>
birth with all the advantages it brings, and the advantage of
the inheritance of great fortunes, makes a clear case of <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></li>

<li><strong>18 and 19&mdash;<abbr title="Exclusion">Ex.</abbr> and <abbr title="Inclusion">In.</abbr></strong>&mdash;Similar relations to those spoken of in
the last paragraph.</li>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">As to the dates of the 100 events, they will cause no difficulty. The
pupil should look upon my formulas as models merely, and make his own
whenever possible. In all the events belonging to this century, we have
only to deal with the last two figures&mdash;(3) <i>M</i>odel (7) <i>Q</i>ueen gives
the date of (18)37. The rule in regard to the month and the day of the
month is very easily applied. A separate word for each figure except for
the three months [October, November and December] where there are two
figures in the one word that expresses the number of the month, as

<h3>A CONCLUDING REMARK.</h3>

<p>If the pupil has painstakingly reviewed this entire work, let him for
the next three months, whenever he wishes to fix anything in mind, not
apply the methods of the system to it, but concentrate his thoughts upon
it with the utmost intensity so that his improved power of assimilation
will seize upon it with an unreleasing grasp, and, then, when the three
months period has passed, he will find that he has consolidated the
Habit of Attention and Memory. <a class="toclink" rel="contents" title="Contents." href="#CONTENTS">&larr;ToC</a></p>

in doing so, when they are clearly indebted to Thomas Hallworth for this

indebtedness.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-D" id="Footnote-D"></a> Pupils who have a poor ear for sounds sometimes fail to
note when &ldquo;n&rdquo; sounds like &ldquo;ng&rdquo; and so means 7 instead of 2. Let them
study the words &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; (474), &ldquo;linger&rdquo; (5774), and &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; (6264).
The first syllable of &ldquo;linger&rdquo; rhymes with the first of &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; and not
with the first of &ldquo;ginger;&rdquo; it rhymes with &ldquo;ring&rdquo; and not with &ldquo;gin;&rdquo;
and if the first syllable of &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; is 47, the first of &ldquo;linger&rdquo; must
be 57; but the second syllable of &ldquo;linger&rdquo; is &ldquo;ger,&rdquo; while the second
syllable of &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; is only &ldquo;er<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original had a comma rather than a period.">.</ins>&rdquo; So &ldquo;linger&rdquo; is pronounced as if
spelled &ldquo;ling-ger,&rdquo; the &ldquo;n&rdquo; sounds like &ldquo;ng.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ringer<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: Original lacked a closing quote mark.">&rdquo;</ins> is pronounced
&ldquo;ring-er,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; as if spelled &ldquo;gin-ger.&rdquo;</p>

spend time hunting for derivations. Unfamiliar words are no help; do not
think the word &ldquo;panification&rdquo; will help you to &ldquo;panis,&rdquo; because it is an
English word meaning &ldquo;bread-making,&rdquo; and you are an Englishman. You
would be much wiser to try to remember the English &ldquo;panification&rdquo; by the
